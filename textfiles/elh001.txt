Tune: LIEBSTER JESU
File: elh001.txt

[1] Blessed Jesus, at Thy Word
    We have gathered all to hear Thee;
    Let our hearts and souls be stirred
    Now to seek and love and fear Thee,
    By Thy teachings, sweet and holy,
    Drawn from earth to love Thee solely.

[2] All our knowledge, sense, and sight
    Lie in deepest darkness shrouded
    Till Thy Spirit breaks our night
    With the beams of truth unclouded.
    Thou alone to God canst win us;
    Thou must work all good within us.

[3] Glorious Lord, Thyself impart,
    Light of Light, from God proceeding;
    Open Thou our ears and heart,
    Help us by Thy Spirit's pleading.
    Hear the cry Thy people raises,
    Hear and bless our prayers and praises.

[4] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
    Praise to Thee and adoration!
    Grant that we Thy Word may trust
    And obtain true consolation
    While we here below must wander,
    Till we sing Thy praises yonder.
    Amen
