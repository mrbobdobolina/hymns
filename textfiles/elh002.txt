[1] Come, Holy Ghost, God and Lord!
    Be all Thy graces now outpoured
    On each believer's mind and heart;
    Thy fervent love to them impart.
    Lord, by the brightness of Thy light
    Thou in the faith doth men unite
    Of ev'ry land and ev'ry tongue;
    This to Thy praise, O Lord, our God, be sung.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

[2] Thou holy Light, Guide Divine,
    Oh, cause the Word of Life to shine.
    Teach us to know our God aright
    And call Him Father with delight.
    From ev'ry error keep us free;
    Let none but Christ our Master be
    That we in living faith abide,
    In Him, our Lord, with all our might confide.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

[3] Thou holy Fire, Comfort true,
    Grant us the will Thy work to do
    And in Thy service to abide;
    Let trials turn us not aside.
    Lord, by Thy pow'r prepare each heart,
    And to our weakness strength impart
    That bravely here we may contend,
    Through life and death to Thee, our Lord, ascend.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    Amen
