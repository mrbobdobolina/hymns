Tune: MELITA
File: elh003a.txt

[1] Come, let us with our Lord arise,
    Our Lord, who made both earth and skies,
    Who died to save the world He made,
    And rose triumphant from the dead;
    He rose, the Prince of life and peace,
    And stamped this day forever His.

[2] This is the day the Lord hath made,
    That all may see his pow'r displayed,
    And know His resurrection's pow'r,
    To rise by grace and fall no more,
    By His own righteousness renewed
    And filled with all the life of God.
    Amen
