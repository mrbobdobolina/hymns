Hymn #4 - In Jesus' Name
Tune: I JESU NAVN
File: elh004.txt

[1] In Jesus' name
    Our work must all be done
    If it shall compass our true good and aim,
    And not end in shame alone;
    For ev'ry deed
    Which in it doth proceed,
    Success and blessing gains
    Till it the goal attains.
    Thus we honor God on high
    And ourselves are blessed thereby;
    Wherein our true good remains.

[2] In Jesus' name
    We praise our God on high,
    He blesses them who spread abroad His fame,
    And we do His will thereby.
    E'er hath the Lord
    Done great things by His Word,
    And still doth bare His arm
    His wonders to perform;
    Hence we should in ev'ry clime
    Magnify His name sublime,
    Who doth shield us from all harm.

[3] In Jesus' name
    We live and we will die;
    If then we live, His love we will proclaim;
    If we die, we gain thereby.
    In Jesus' name,
    Who from heav'n to us came,
    We shall again arise
    To meet Him in the skies,
    When at last, saved by His grace,
    We shall see Him face to face,
    Live with Him in Paradise.
    Amen
