Tune: HERR JESU CHRIST, DICH ZU UNS WEND
File: elh005.txt

[1] Lord Jesus, though but two or three
    In Your dear name assembled be,
    You will among them show Your face
    And bless them with Your saving grace.

[2] In Your dear name again we meet
    And worship humbly at your feet;
    You will Your gracious Word fulfill
    And cheer us with Your presence still.

[3] Jesus, from whom all blessings flow,
    Your peace and comfort now bestow;
    Abide with us till life is o'er
    And keep us Yours forevermore.
    Amen
