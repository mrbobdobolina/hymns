File: elh006.txt

[1] Alleluia! Let praises ring!
    To God the Father let us bring
    Our songs of adoration.
    To Him through everlasting days
    Be worship, honor, pow'r, and praise,
    Whose hand sustains creation.
    Singing, Ringing.
    Holy, holy, God is holy;
    Spread the story
    Of our God, the Lord of glory.

[2] Alleluia! Let praises ring!
    Unto the Lamb of God we sing,
    In whom we are elected.
    He bought His Church with His own blood,
    He cleansed her in that blessed flood,
    And as His Bride selected.
    Holy! Holy
    Is our union And communion.
    His befriending
    Gives us joy and peace unending.

[3] Alleluia! Let praises ring!
    Unto the Holy Ghost we sing
    For our regeneration.
    The saving faith in us He wrought
    And us unto the Bridegroom brought.
    Made us His chosen nation.
    Glory! Glory!
    Joy eternal, Bliss supernal;
    There is manna
    And an endless, glad hosanna.

[4] Alleluia! Let praises ring!
    Unto our Triune God we sing;
    Blest be His name forever!
    With angel hosts let us adore
    And sing His praises more and more
    For all His grace and favor.
    Singing, Ringing:
    Holy, holy, God is holy--
    Spread the story
    Of our God, the Lord of glory!
    Amen
