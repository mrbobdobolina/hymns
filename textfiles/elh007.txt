Tune: LOBE DEN HERREN, DEN
File: elh007.txt

[1] Praise to the Father, the glorious King of creation!
    Swell the loud chorus, ye chosen of every nation!
    O my soul, wake!
    Harp, lute and psaltery take;
    Sound forth thy true adoration.

[2] Praise to the Son: for the cross that once shamefully bore Him,
    Now, on the throne of His pow'r let all creatures adore Him!
    Man reigns on high!
    Lo! all the hosts of the sky
    Bow down and worship before Him!

[3] Praise to the Spirit, whose strong, rushing wind, ever blowing,
    Still through the world, wheresoever it wisheth, is going.
    Darkness and death
    Drink, from Thy quickening breath
    Life, light, and joy overflowing.

[4] Lord God Almighty, Creator, Redeemer, and Giver,
    Thy praise resounds by the shore of the bright crystal river.
    We, too, would fain
    Echoing humbly the strain,
    Praise Thee for ever and ever.
    Amen
