Hymn #8 - Christ Is Made the Sure Foundation
Tune: LAUDA ANIMA
File: elh008.txt

[1] Christ is made the sure foundation,
    Christ, the head and cornerstone,
    Chosen of the Lord, and precious,
    Binding all the Church in one,
    Holy Zion's help for ever,
    And her confidence alone.

[2] All that dedicated city,
    Dearly loved of God on high,
    In exultant jubilation
    Pours perpetual melody;
    God the One in Three adoring
    In glad hymns eternally.

[3] To this temple, where we call Thee,
    Come, O Lord of hosts, today;
    With Thy tender loving kindness
    Hear Thy people as they pray,
    And Thy fullest benediction
    Shed within its walls alway.

[4] Here vouchsafe to all Thy servants
    What they ask of Thee to gain,
    What they gain from Thee forever
    With the blessed to retain,
    And hereafter in Thy glory
    Evermore with Thee to reign.

[5] Laud and honor to the Father,
    Laud and honor to the Son,
    Laud and honor to the Spirit,
    Ever Three and ever One,
    One in might, and One in glory,
    While unending ages run.
    Amen
