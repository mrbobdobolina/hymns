Hymn #9 - Come Down, O Love Divine
Tune: DOWN AMPNEY
File: elh009.txt

[1] Come down, O Love divine;
    Seek Thou this soul of mine,
    And visit it with Thine own ardor glowing;
    O Comforter, draw near,
    Within my heart appear,
    And kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.

[2] O let it freely burn,
    Till earthly passions turn
    To dust and ashes in its heat consuming;
    And let Thy glorious light
    Shine ever on my sight
    And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.
    Amen
