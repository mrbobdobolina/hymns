File: elh010.txt

[1] Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest,
    Vouchsafe within our souls to rest;
    Come with Thy grace and heav'nly aid,
    And fill the hearts which Thou hast made.

[2] To Thee, the Comforter, we cry
    To Thee, the Gift of God most high;
    The Fount of life, the Fire of love,
    The soul's Anointing from above.

[3] The sev'nfold gifts of grace are Thine,
    O Finger of the Hand Divine;
    True Promise of the Father Thou,
    Who dost the tongue with speech endow.

[4] Thy light to ev'ry thought impart,
    And shed Thy love in ev'ry heart;
    The weakness of our mortal state
    With deathless might invigorate.

[5] Drive far away our wily foe
    And Thine abiding peace bestow;
    If Thou be our protecting Guide,
    No evil can our steps betide.

[6] Make Thou to us the Father known;
    Teach us th' eternal Son to own
    And Thee, whose name we ever bless,
    Of both the Spirit, to confess.

[7] Praise we the Father and the Son
    And Holy Spirit, Three in One,
    And may the Son on us bestow
    The gifts that from the Spirit flow.
    Amen
