Tune: ITALIAN HYMN
File: elh012.txt

[1] Come, Thou almighty King;
    Help us Thy name to sing;
    Help us to praise.
    Father all glorious,
    O'er all victorious,
    Come and reign over us,
    Ancient of Days.

[2] Jesus our Lord, descend;
    From all our foes defend,
    Nor let us fall;
    Let Thine almighty aid
    Our sure defense be made:
    Our souls on Thee be stayed;
    Lord, hear our call.

[3] Come, Thou Incarnate Word;
    Gird on Thy mighty sword;
    Our pray'r attend.
    Come and Thy people bless,
    And give Thy Word success;
    Spirit of Holiness,
    On us descend.

[4] Come, holy Comforter;
    Thy sacred witness bear
    In this glad hour.
    Thou who almighty art;
    Now rule in ev'ry heart;
    And ne'er from us depart,
    Spirit of pow'r.

[5] To the great One in Three
    Eternal praises be
    Hence evermore!
    His sov'reign majesty
    May we in glory see
    And to eternity
    Love and adore.
    Amen
