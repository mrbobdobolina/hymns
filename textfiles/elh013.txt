Tune: WERDE MUNTER
File: elh013.txt

[1] Dearest Jesus, draw Thou near me,
    Let Thy Spirit dwell with mine;
    Open now my ear to hear Thee,
    Take my heart and seal it Thine;
    Keep me, lead me on my way
    Thee to follow and obey;
    E'er to do Thy will and fear Thee,
    And rejoice to know and hear Thee.

[2] Underneath Thy wings abiding,
    In Thy Church, O Savior dear,
    Let me dwell, in Thee confiding,
    Hold me in Thy faith and fear;
    Take away from me each thought
    That with wickedness is fraught,
    Tempting me to disobey Thee,
    Root it out, O Lord, I pray Thee.

[3] Thou, earth's greatest joy and gladness,
    And salvation, full and free,
    Let Thy presence cheer my sadness,
    And prepare my soul for Thee!
    In the hour when I depart,
    Touch my spirit, lips and heart,
    With Thy word assure, uphold me
    Till the heav'nly gates enfold me.
    Amen
