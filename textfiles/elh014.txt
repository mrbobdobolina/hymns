Hymn #14 - Father, Who the Light This Day
Tune: FRED TIL BOD
File: elh014.txt

[1] Father, who the light this day
    Out of darkness didst create,
    Shine upon us now, we pray,
    While within Thy courts we wait;
    Wean us from the works of night,
    Make us children of the light.

[2] Savior, who this day didst break
    From the bondage of the tomb,
    Bid our slumb'ring souls awake,
    And dispel their doubt and gloom;
    Let us, from our bonds set free,
    Rise from sin and live to Thee.

[3] Blessed Spirit, Comforter,
    Sent this day from Christ on high,
    Lord, on us Thy gifts confer,
    Cleanse, illumine, sanctify;
    All Thine influence shed abroad;
    Lead us to the truth of God.
    Amen
