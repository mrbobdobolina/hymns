Tune: NICAEA
File: elh015.txt

[1] Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
    Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
    Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
    God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!

[2] Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee,
    Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
    Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
    Which wert and art and evermore shall be.

[3] Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee,
    Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see:
    Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee.
    Perfect in pow'r, in love, and purity.

[4] Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
    All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea.
    Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
    God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!
    Amen
