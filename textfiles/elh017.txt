Hymn #17 - Awake and Sing the Song
Tune: ST. THOMAS
File: elh017.txt

[1] Awake and sing the song
    Of Moses and the Lamb;
    Tune ev'ry heart and ev'ry tongue
    To praise the Savior's name.

[2] Sing of His dying love,
    Sing of His rising pow'r;
    Sing how He intercedes above
    For those whose sins He bore.

[3] Come, children of His grace,
    Do not refuse to sing,
    But summon all your pow'rs to praise
    Your Savior and your King.

[4] Look back and see the state
    Wherein your nature lay
    Then wonder at His love so great
    Who did your ransom pay.

[5] May Jesus' Word take place
    And wisdom in us dwell
    That he His miracles of grace
    In psalms and hymns may tell.

[6] Tell in angelic strains
    What Christ has done for you,
    How He has taken off your chains
    And formed your hearts anew.

[7] Leave earthly joys below
    To those of worldly taste;
    Think, speak, and sing of nothing now
    But Christ, the first and last.

[8] Sing, for you hear Christ say,
    "Your sins are all forgiv'n."
    Go forth, rejoicing all the way,
    And singing enter heav'n.
    Amen
