File: elh018.txt

[1] God, the Father, be our Stay;

[Refrain] O let us perish never!
          Cleanse us from our sins, we pray,
          And grant us life forever.
          Keep us from the evil one;
          Uphold our faith most holy,
          Grant us to trust Thee solely
          With humble hearts and lowly.
          Let us put God's armor on,
          With all true Christians running
          Our heav'nly race and shunning
          The devil's wiles and cunning,
          Amen, amen! This be done;
          So sing we, "Alleluia!"

[2] Jesus Christ, be Thou our Stay;

[Refrain] O let us perish never!
          Cleanse us from our sins, we pray,
          And grant us life forever.
          Keep us from the evil one;
          Uphold our faith most holy,
          Grant us to trust Thee solely
          With humble hearts and lowly.
          Let us put God's armor on,
          With all true Christians running
          Our heav'nly race and shunning
          The devil's wiles and cunning,
          Amen, amen! This be done;
          So sing we, "Alleluia!"

[3] Holy Ghost, be Thou our Stay;

[Refrain] O let us perish never!
          Cleanse us from our sins, we pray,
          And grant us life forever.
          Keep us from the evil one;
          Uphold our faith most holy,
          Grant us to trust Thee solely
          With humble hearts and lowly.
          Let us put God's armor on,
          With all true Christians running
          Our heav'nly race and shunning
          The devil's wiles and cunning,
          Amen, amen! This be done;
          So sing we, "Alleluia!"
