Tune: ORIENTIS PARTIBUS
File: elh019.txt

[1] Now may He who from the dead
    Brought the Shepherd of the sheep,
    Jesus Christ, our King and Head,
    All our souls in safety keep!

[2] May He teach us to fulfill
    What is pleasing in His sight,
    Perfect us in all His will,
    And preserve us day and night!

[3] To that dear Redeemer's praise,
    Who the cov'nant sealed with blood,
    Let our hearts and voices raise
    Loud thanksgivings to our God.
    Amen
