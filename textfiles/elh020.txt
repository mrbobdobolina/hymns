Hymn #20 - Holy Ghost, Dispel Our Sadness
Tune: GENEVA
File: elh020.txt

[1] Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness;
    Pierce the clouds of sinful night;
    Come, Thou source of sweetest gladness,
    Breathe Thy life and spread Thy light!
    Hear, O hear our supplication,
    Loving Spirit, God of peace!
    Rest upon this congregation,
    Great distributer of grace!

[2] From the height which knows no measure
    As a gracious show'r descend,
    Bringing down the richest treasure
    We can wish, or God can send!
    Make us flee what Thou refusest,
    Both from error and from sin.
    Make us joy in what Thou choosest,
    Holy Fountain, wash us clean.

[3] Be our friend on each occasion,
    God, omnipotent to save!
    When we die, be our salvation,
    When we're buried be our grave.
    Seat us with Thy saints in glory,
    When from out the grave we rise,
    Then forever we'll adore Thee,
    Round Thy throne above the skies.
    Amen
