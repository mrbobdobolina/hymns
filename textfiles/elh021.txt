File: elh021.txt

[1] To God be glory, peace on earth,
    To all mankind good will!
    We bless, we praise, we worship Thee,
    And glorify Thee still.

[2] And thanks for Thy great glory give,
    That fills our soul with light,
    O Lord, our heav'nly King, the God
    And Father of all might!

[3] And Thou, begotten Son of God,
    Before all time begun;
    O Jesus Christ, Thou Lamb of God,
    The Father's only Son:

[4] Have mercy, Thou that tak'st the sins
    Of all the world away!
    Have mercy, Savior of mankind,
    And hear us when we pray!

[5] O Thou, who sitt'st at God's right hand,
    Upon the Father's throne,
    Have mercy on us Thou, O Christ,
    Who art the Holy One!

[6] Thou only, with the Holy Ghost,
    Whom earth and heav'n adore,
    In glory of the Father art
    Most high forevermore.
    Amen
