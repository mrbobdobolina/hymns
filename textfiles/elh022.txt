Hymn #22 - Let All the World in Every Corner Sing
Tune: UNDIQUE GLORIA
File: elh022.txt

[1] Let all the world
    in ev'ry corner sing:
    My God and King!
    The heav'ns are not too high,
    His praise may thither fly;
    The earth is not too low,
    His praises there may grow.
    Let all the world
    in ev'ry corner sing:
    My God and King!

[2] Let all the world
    in ev'ry corner sing:
    My God and King!
    The Church with psalms must shout;
    No door can keep them out;
    But, above all, the heart
    Must bear the longest part.
    Let all the world
    in ev'ry corner sing:
    My God and King!

[3] Let all the world
    in ev'ry corner sing:
    My God and King!
    The Father, with the Son,
    And Spirit, Three in One,
    One everlasting Lord,
    Be evermore adored!
    Let all the world
    in ev'ry corner sing:
    My God and King!
    Amen
