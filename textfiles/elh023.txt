File: elh023.txt

[1] Lord Jesus Christ, be present now,
    And let Thy Holy Spirit bow
    All hearts in love and fear today
    To hear the truth and keep Thy way.

[2] Unseal our lips to sing Thy praise,
    Our hearts in true devotion raise,
    Our faith increase, our minds enlight
    That we may know Thy name aright

[3] Until we join the hosts that cry,
    "Holy art Thou, O Lord most high!"
    And 'mid the light of that blest place
    Shall gaze upon Thee face to face.

[4] Glory to God the Father, Son,
    And Holy Spirit, Three in One!
    To Thee, O blessed Trinity,
    Be praise throughout eternity!
    Amen
