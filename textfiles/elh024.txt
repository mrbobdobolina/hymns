Tune: ERHALT UNS, HERR
File: elh024.txt

[1] Lord, open Thou my heart to hear
    And through Thy Word to me draw near;
    Let me Thy Word e'er pure retain;
    Let me Thy child and heir remain.

[2] Thy Word doth deeply more the heart,
    Thy Word doth perfect health impart,
    Thy Word my soul with joy doth bless,
    Thy Word brings peace and happiness.

[3] To God the Father, God the Son,
    And God the Spirit, Three in One,
    Shall glory, praise, and honor be
    Now and throughout eternity.
    Amen
