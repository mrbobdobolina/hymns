Hymn #25 - O Holy Spirit, Grant Us Grace
Tune: ES IST GEWISSLICH
File: elh025.txt

[1] O Holy Spirit, grant us grace
    That we our Lord and Savior
    In faith and fervent love embrace
    And truly serve Him ever,
    So that when death is drawing nigh
    We to His open wounds may fly
    And find in them salvation.

[2] Help us that we Thy saving Word
    In faithful hearts may treasure;
    Let e'er that bread of life afford
    New grace in richest measure.
    Yea, let us die to ev'ry sin;
    For heav'n create us new within
    That fruits of faith may flourish.

[3] And when our earthly race is run,
    Death's bitter hour impending,
    Then may Thy work in us begun
    Continue till life's ending,
    Until we gladly may commend
    Our souls into our Savior's hand
    To rest in peace eternal.
    Amen
