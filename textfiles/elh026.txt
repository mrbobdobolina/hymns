Hymn #26 - O Holy Ghost, Thou Gift Divine
Tune: MIT FREUDEN ZART
File: elh026.txt

[1] O Holy Ghost, Thou gift divine,
    And giver of all blessing,
    Thou, with the Father and the Son,
    The Godhead art possessing,
    And from them both art shed abroad,
    Eternal Spirit, Lord and God,
    In Thee all Christians glory.

[2] O Spirit blest, we Thee entreat:
    O grant us that we ever
    With heart and soul, as it is meet,
    May serve our Lord and Savior,
    And Him confess till our last breath,
    As Lord of life and Lord of death
    And give Him praise and honor.

[3] Our hearts let new-created be,
    Our walk make pure and holy.
    Help us offense and sin to flee,
    And ever serve God solely,
    So that our faith in Christ, our Lord,
    May prove itself in deed and word
    Before the world about us.

[4] Thy gracious heav'nly dew let fall,
    The fainting Church to quicken;
    Thy soothing ointment pour on all
    Whose souls are sad and stricken.
    Sustain us, Lord, in evil days,
    And let our lives in all our ways
    Abound in love and mercy.

[5] Give strength and courage to contend
    Against the hosts of evil,
    That we may vanquish, in the end,
    The world, the flesh, the devil;
    And when death's billow o'er us rolls,
    Bear Thou to heav'n our ransomed souls
    While dust to dust returneth.
    Amen
