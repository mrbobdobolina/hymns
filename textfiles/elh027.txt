File: elh027.txt

[1] O Holy Spirit, enter in
    And in our hearts Thy work begin,
    Thy temple deign to make us.
    Sun of the soul, Thou Light divine,
    Around and in us brightly shine,
    To joy and gladness wake us.
    That we To Thee Truly living,
    To Thee giving Prayer unceasing,
    Still may be in love increasing.

[2] Give to Thy Word impressive pow'r
    That in our hearts from this good hour
    As fire it may be glowing,
    That we confess the Father, Son,
    And Thee, the Spirit, Three in One,
    Thy glory ever showing.
    O stay And sway Our souls ever,
    That they never May forsake Thee,
    But by faith their refuge make Thee.

[3] Thou Fountain whence all wisdom flows,
    Which God on pious hearts bestows,
    Grant us Thy consolation.
    That in our pure faith's unity
    We faithful witnesses may be,
    Of grace that brings salvation.
    Hear us, Cheer us By Thy teaching;
    Let our preaching And our labor
    Praise Thee, Lord, and bless our neighbor.

[4] Left to ourselves we shall but stray;
    O lead us in the narrow way,
    With wisest counsel guide us;
    And give us steadfastness that we
    May ever faithful prove to Thee,
    Whatever woes betide us.
    Lord, now Heal Thou All hearts broken;
    And betoken Thou art near us,
    Whom we trust to light and cheer us.

[5] Thy heav'nly strength sustain our heart,
    That we may act the valiant part
    With Thee as our reliance.
    Be Thou our refuge and our shield,
    That we may never quit the field,
    Bidding all foes defiance.
    Descend, Defend From all errors
    And earth's terrors: Thy salvation
    Be our constant consolation.

[6] O mighty Rock, O Source of life,
    Let Thy dear Word, 'mid doubt and strife,
    Be so within us burning
    That we be faithful unto death,
    In Thy pure love and holy faith,
    From Thee true wisdom learning.
    Thy grace And peace On us shower;
    By Thy power Christ confessing,
    Let us win our Savior's blessing.

[7] O gentle Dew, from heav'n now fall
    With pow'r upon the hearts of all,
    Thy tender love instilling.
    That heart to heart more closely bound,
    Fruitful in kindly deeds be found,
    The law of love fulfilling.
    Then, Lord, Discord Shall not grieve Thee;
    We receive Thee; Where Thou livest,
    Peace, and love, and joy Thou givest.

[8] Grant that our days, while life shall last,
    In purest holiness be passed,
    Be Thou our strength forever.
    Grant that our hearts henceforth be free
    From sinful lust and vanity,
    Which us from Thee must sever.
    Keep Thou Pure now From offenses
    Heart and senses. Blessed Spirit!
    Let us heav'nly life inherit.
    Amen
