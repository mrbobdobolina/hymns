Hymn #28 - O How Holy Is This Place
Tune: JESUS, MEINE ZUVERSICHT
File: elh028.txt

[1] O how holy is this place
    Where the Lord a house hath given!
    Here we come before His face;
    This must be the gate of heaven.
    Here His Word proclaims His grace.
    O how holy is this place!

[2] Thousand thanks, great God, arise
    Unto thee, in grace excelling.
    Who, though filling all the skies,
    Yet dost make this house Thy dwelling,
    And to us dost here dispense
    Thy pure Word and Sacraments.

[3] Hitherto upon this house
    Hath salvation surely rested.
    Here our God hath been with us,
    And Himself hath manifested.
    Here His Spirit he hath giv'n
    To reveal the way to heav'n.

[4] O how lovely, meet and right
    In His temple to adore Him!
    Let us now in Him delight,
    And with gladness come before Him.
    Treasures lasting, precious, pure,
    From above we here secure.

[5] Dearest Guest, with us abide,
    With Thy holy Word still feed us;
    Hitherto by Thee supplied,
    Still by living waters lead us!
    Keep Thy Church on earth secure
    While the earth itself endure.
    Amen
