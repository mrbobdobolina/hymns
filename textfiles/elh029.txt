Hymn #29 - Open Now Thy Gates of Beauty
Tune: UNSER HERRSCHER
File: elh029.txt

[1] Open now Thy gates of beauty;
    Zion, let me enter there,
    Where my soul in joyful duty
    Waits for Him who answers prayer.
    O how blessed is this place,
    Filled with solace, light, and grace!

[2] Lord, my God, I come before Thee;
    Do not hide Thy face from me.
    Where we find Thee and adore Thee,
    There a heav'n on earth must be.
    To my heart, O enter Thou;
    Let it be Thy temple now.

[3] Here Thy praise is gladly chanted;
    Here Thy seed is duly sown.
    Let my soul, where it is planted,
    Bring forth precious sheaves alone,
    So that all I hear may be
    Fruitful unto life in me.

[4] Thou my faith increase and quicken,
    Let me keep Thy gift divine;
    Howsoe'er temptations thicken,
    May Thy Word still o'er me shine
    As my guiding star through life,
    As my comfort in all strife.

[5] Speak, O God, and I will hear Thee;
    Let Thy will be done indeed;
    May I undisturbed draw near Thee
    While Thou dost Thy people feed;
    Here the living waters flow,
    Here is balm for all our woe.
    Amen
