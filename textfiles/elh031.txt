Hymn #31 - This Day at Thy Creating Word
Tune: WINCHESTER NEW
File: elh031.txt

[1] This day at Thy creating Word
    First o'er the earth the light was poured:
    O Lord, this day upon us shine
    And fill our souls with light divine.

[2] This day the Lord for sinners slain
    In might victorious rose again:
    O Jesus, may we raised be
    From death of sin to life in Thee.

[3] This day the Holy Spirit came
    With fiery tongues of cloven flame:
    O Spirit, fill our hearts this day
    With grace to hear and grace to pray.

[4] O day of light and life and grace
    From earthly toil sweet resting-place,
    Thy hallowed hours, blest gift of love,
    Give we again to God above.

[5] All praise to God the Father be,
    All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
    Whom, with the Spirit, we adore
    Forever and forevermore.
    Amen
