Hymn #32 - This Is the Day the Lord Hath Made
Tune: NUN DANKET ALL
File: elh032.txt

[1] This is the day the Lord hath made;
    He calls the hours His own.
    Let heav'n rejoice, let earth be glad
    And praise surround the throne.

[2] Today He rose and left the dead,
    And Satan's empire fell;
    Today the saints His triumphs spread
    And all His wonders tell.

[3] Hosanna to th' anointed King,
    To David's holy Son!
    Help us, O Lord; descend and bring
    Salvation from the throne.

[4] Blest be the Lord, who comes to men
    With messages of grace,
    Who comes in God His Father's name
    To save our sinful race.

[5] Hosanna in the highest strains
    The Church on earth can raise;
    The highest heav'ns, in which He reigns,
    Shall give Him nobler praise.
    Amen
