Tune: NUN BITTEN WIR
File: elh033.txt

[1] We now implore God the Holy Ghost
    For the true faith, which we need the most,
    That in our last moments He may befriend us
    And, as homeward we journey, attend us.
    Lord, have mercy!

[2] Shine in our hearts, O most precious Light,
    That we Jesus Christ may know aright,
    Clinging to our Savior, whose blood hath bought us,
    Who again to our homeland hath brought us.
    Lord, have mercy!

[3] Thou sacred Love, grace on us bestow,
    Set our hearts with heav'nly fire aglow
    That with hearts united we love each other,
    Of one mind, in peace with ev'ry brother.
    Lord, have mercy!

[4] Thou highest Comfort in ev'ry need,
    Grant that neither shame nor death we heed,
    That e'en then our courage may never fail us
    When the Foe shall accuse and assail us.
    Lord, have mercy!
    Amen
