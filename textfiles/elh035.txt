Tune: ALLEIN GOTT IN DER HOH
File: elh035.txt

[1] All glory be to God on high,
    Who hath our race befriended!
    To us no harm shall now come nigh,
    The strife at last is ended.
    God showeth His good will to men,
    And peace shall reign on earth again;
    O thank Him for His goodness!

[2] We praise, we worship Thee, we trust,
    And give Thee thanks forever,
    O Father, that Thy rule is just
    And wise and changes never.
    Thy boundless pow'r o'er all things reigns,
    Done is whate'er Thy will ordains;
    Well for us that Thou rulest.

[3] O Jesus Christ, Thou only Son
    Of God, Thy heav'nly Father,
    Who didst for all our sins atone
    And Thy lost sheep dost gather;
    Thou Lamb of God, to Thee on high
    From out our depths we sinners cry,
    Have mercy on us, Jesus!

[4] O Holy Ghost, Thou precious Gift,
    Thou Comforter unfailing,
    O'er Satan's snares our souls uplift
    And let Thy pow'r availing
    Avert our woes and calm our dread.
    For us the Savior's blood was shed;
    We trust in Thee to save us.
    Amen
