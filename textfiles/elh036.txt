Tune: ALL EHR UND LOB
File: elh036.txt

[1] All glory be to God alone,
    Forevermore the Highest One,
    Who doth our sinful race befriend
    And grace and peace to us extend.
    Among mankind may His good will
    All hearts with deep thanksgiving fill.

[2] We praise Thee, God, and Thee we bless;
    We worship Thee in humbleness;
    From day to day we glorify
    Thee, everlasting God on high.
    Of Thy great glory do we sing,
    And e'er to Thee our thanks we bring.

[3] Lord God, our King on heaven's throne,
    Our Father, the Almighty One.
    O Lord, the Sole-begotten One,
    Lord Jesus Christ, the Father's Son,
    True God from all eternity,
    O Lamb of God, to Thee we flee.

[4] Thou dost the world's sin take away;
    Have mercy on us, Lord, we pray.
    Thou dost the world's sin take away;
    Give ear unto the prayer we say.
    Thou sitt'st as God's right hand for aye;
    Have mercy on us, Lord, we pray.

[5] Thou only art the Holy One;
    Thou art o'er all things Lord alone.
    O Jesus Christ, we glorify
    Thee only as the Lord Most High;
    Thou art, the Holy Ghost with Thee,
    One in the Father's majesty.

[6] Amen, this ever true shall be,
    As angels sing adoringly.
    By all creation, far and wide,
    Thou, Lord, art ever glorified;
    And Thee all Christendom doth praise
    Now and through everlasting days.
    Amen
