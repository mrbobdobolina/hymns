Hymn #37 - We All Believe in One True God
Tune: WIR GLAUBEN ALL AN EINEN GOTT
File: elh037.txt

[1] We all believe in one true God,
    Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
    Ever-present Help in need,
    Praised by all the heav'nly host,
    By whose mighty pow'r alone
    All is made and wrought and done.

[2] We all believe in Jesus Christ,
    Son of God and Mary's Son,
    Who descended from His throne
    And for us salvation won,
    By whose cross and death are we
    Rescued from all misery.

[3] We all confess the Holy Ghost,
    Who from both fore'er proceeds,
    Who upholds and comforts us
    In all trials, fears, and needs.
    Blest and Holy Trinity,
    Praise forever be to Thee!
    Amen
