Hymn #38 - We All Believe in One True God
Tune: WIR GLAUBEN ALL
File: elh038.txt

[1] We all believe in one true God,
    Who created earth and heaven,
    The Father, who to us in love
    Hath the right of children given.
    He both soul and body feedeth,
    All we need He doth provide us.
    He through snares and perils leadeth,
    Watching that no harm betide us.
    He careth for us day and night;
    All things are governed by His might.

[2] We all believe in Jesus Christ,
    His own Son, our Lord, possessing
    An equal Godhead, throne, and might,
    Source of ev'ry grace and blessing.
    Born of Mary, virgin mother,
    By the power of the Spirit,
    Made true man, our elder Brother,
    That the lost might life inherit.
    Was crucified for sinful men
    And raised by God to life again.

[3] We all confess the Holy Ghost,
    Who sweet grace and comfort giveth
    And with the Father and the Son
    In eternal glory liveth,
    Who the Church, His own creation,
    Keeps in unity of spirit.
    Here forgiveness and salvation
    Daily come through Jesus' merit.
    All flesh shall rise, and we shall be
    In bliss with God eternally.
    Amen
