File: elh041.txt

[Refrain] Lamb of God, pure and holy,
          Who on the cross didst suffer,
          Ever patient and lowly,
          Thyself to scorn did offer.
          All sins Thou carried for us,
          Else had despair reigned o'er us:

[1] Have mercy on us,
    O Jesus! O Jesus!

[3] Thy peace be with us,
    O Jesus! O Jesus!
