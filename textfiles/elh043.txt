Tune: GROSSER GOTT, WIR LOBEN DICH
File: elh043.txt

[1] Holy God, we praise Thy name;
    Lord of all, we bow before Thee.
    All on earth Thy scepter claim,
    All in heav'n above adore Thee.
    Infinite Thy vast domain,
    Everlasting is Thy reign.

[2] Hark! the glad celestial hymn
    Angel choirs above are raising;
    Cherubim and seraphim,
    In unceasing chorus praising,
    Fill the heav'ns with sweet accord:
    "Holy, holy, holy Lord!"

[3] Lo, th' apostles' holy train
    Join Thy sacred name to hallow;
    Prophets swell the glad refrain,
    And the white robed martyrs follow;
    And from morn to set of sun
    Through the Church the song goes on.

[4] Holy Father, holy Son,
    Holy Spirit, three we name Thee;
    Though in essence only one;
    Undivided God we claim Thee
    And, adoring, bend the knee
    While we own the mystery.

[5] King of glory, Thou, O Christ;
    Son of God, yet born of Mary,
    For us sinners sacrificed,
    On the cross our sins didst carry;
    First to break the bars of death,
    Thou hast opened heav'n to faith.

[6] From Thy high celestial home,
    Judge of all, again returning,
    We believe that Thou shalt come
    On the dreadful Judgment morning
    When Thy voice shall shake the earth
    And the startled dead come forth.

[7] Spare Thy people, Lord, we pray,
    By a thousand snares surrounded;
    Keep us without sin today,
    Never let us be confounded.
    Lo, I put my trust in Thee;
    Never, Lord, abandon me.
    Amen
