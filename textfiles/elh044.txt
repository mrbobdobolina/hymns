Tune: OLD HUNDREDTH
File: elh044.txt

[1] Thee, God, we praise, Thy name we bless,
    Thee, Lord, of all we do confess;
    The whole creation worships Thee,
    The Father of eternity.

[2] To Thee aloud all angels cry,
    The heav'ns and all the pow'rs on high,
    The cherubs and the seraphs join,
    And thus they hymn Thy praise divine:

[3] O holy, holy, holy Lord,
    Thou, God, of hosts, by all adored;
    Earth and the heav'ns are full of Thee,
    Thy light, Thy pow'r, Thy majesty.

[4] The apostles join the glorious throng,
    The prophets swell the immortal song,
    The white-robed hosts of martyrs bright
    All serve and praise Thee day and night.

[5] The holy Church in ev'ry place
    Throughout the world exalts Thy praise,
    And ever doth acknowledge Thee,
    Father of boundless majesty.

[6] O God eternal, mighty King,
    We unto Thee our praises bring;
    And to Thy true and only Son,
    And Holy Spirit, Three in One.

[7] O King of glory, Christ the Lord,
    God's everlasting Son--the Word,
    To rescue mankind from its doom,
    Thou didst our very flesh assume.

[8] Thou overcamest death's sharp sting,
    Believers unto heav'n to bring;
    At God's right hand, exalted there,
    Thou dost the Father's glory share.

[9] And we believe Thou wilt descend
    To be our judge, when comes the end;
    Thy servants help, whom Thou, O God,
    Hast ransomed with Thy precious blood.

[10] Among Thy saints let us be found
     With glory everlasting crowned;
     Thy people save from age to age,
     And bless Thy chosen heritage.

[11] O guide them, lift them up for aye:
     We magnify Thee day by day,
     Thy name we worship and adore,
     World without end, for evermore.

[12] Vouchsafe, O Lord, we humbly pray,
     To keep us safe from sin this day:
     O Lord, have mercy on us all,
     Have mercy on us when we call.

[13] Thy mercy, Lord, to us extend,
     As on Thy mercy we depend.
     Lord, I have put my trust in Thee,
     Confounded let me never be.
     Amen
