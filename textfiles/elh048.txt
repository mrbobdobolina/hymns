Hymn #48 - In Peace and Joy I Now Depart
Tune: MIT FRIED UND FREUD
File: elh048.txt

[1] In peace and joy I now depart
    At God's disposing;
    For full of comfort is my heart;
    Soft reposing.
    So the Lord hath promised me,
    And death is but a slumber.

[2] 'Tis Christ that wrought this work for me,
    My faithful Savior,
    Whom Thou hast made mine eyes to see
    By Thy favor.
    Now I know He is my Life,
    My Help in need and dying.

[3] Him Thou hast unto all set forth
    Their great Salvation;
    And to His kingdom called the earth,
    Ev'ry nation.
    By Thy dear and wholesome Word,
    In ev'ry place resounding.

[4] He is the Hope and saving Light
    Of lands benighted;
    By Him are they who dwelt in night
    Fed and lighted.
    He is Israel's Praise and Bliss,
    Their Joy, Reward, and Glory.
    Amen
