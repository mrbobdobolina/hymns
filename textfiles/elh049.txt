File: elh049.txt

[1] All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name!
    Let angels prostrate fall;
    Bring forth the royal diadem
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    Bring forth the royal diadem
    And crown Him Lord of all.

[2] Crown Him, ye martyrs of our God,
    Who from His altar call;
    Extol the Stem of Jesse's rod
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    Extol the Stem of Jesse's rod
    And crown Him Lord of all.

[3] Ye seed of Israel's chosen race,
    Ye ransomed from the fall,
    Hail Him who saves you by His grace
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    Hail Him who saves you by His grace
    And crown Him Lord of all.

[4] Hail Him, ye heirs of David's line,
    Whom David Lord did call,
    The God Incarnate, Man divine,
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    The God Incarnate, man divine,
    And crown Him Lord of all.

[5] Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget
    The wormwood and the gall,
    Go, spread your trophies at His feet
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    Go, spread your trophies at His feet
    And crown Him Lord of all.

[6] Let ev'ry kindred, ev'ry tribe,
    On this terrestrial ball
    To Him all majesty ascribe
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    To Him all majesty ascribe
    And crown Him Lord of all.

[7] O that with yonder sacred throng
    We at His feet may fall!
    We'll join the everlasting song
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    We'll join the everlasting song
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    Amen
