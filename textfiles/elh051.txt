Hymn #51 - All People That on Earth Do Dwell
Tune: OLD HUNDREDTH
File: elh051.txt

[1] All people that on earth do dwell,
    Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
    Him serve with fear, His praise forthtell;
    Come ye before Him and rejoice.

[2] The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;
    Without our aid He did us make.
    We are His folk; He doth us feed,
    And for His sheep He doth us take.

[3] O enter then His gates with praise;
    Approach with joy His courts unto;
    Praise, laud, and bless His name always,
    For it is seemly so to do.

[4] For why? The Lord, our God, is good:
    His mercy is forever sure.
    His truth at all times firmly stood
    And shall from age to age endure.

[5] To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
    The God whom heav'n and earth adore,
    From men and from the angel host
    Be praise and glory evermore.
    Amen
