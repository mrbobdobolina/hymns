Hymn #52 - All Ye Who on This Earth Do Dwell
Tune: NUN DANKET ALL
File: elh052.txt

[1] All ye who on this earth do dwell,
    Give thanks and glorify
    The Lord whose praises ever swell
    In seraph songs on high.

[2] Lift up your hearts in praise to God,
    Himself best Gift of all,
    Who works His wonders all abroad,
    Upholding great and small.

[3] Since first our life began to be,
    He has preserved our frame;
    And when man's strength was vanity,
    He as our Helper came.

[4] Though often we His patience try
    And well deserve His frown,
    In grace He lays His anger by
    And pours new blessings down.

[5] 'Tis He revives our fainting soul,
    Gives joyful hearts to men;
    And when great waves of trouble roll,
    He drives them back again.

[6] May He adorn with precious peace
    Our own, our native, land
    And crown with joys that never cease
    The labors of our hand!

[7] Long as we tarry here below
    Our saving Health is He;
    And when from earth to heav'n we go,
    May He our Portion be!
    Amen
