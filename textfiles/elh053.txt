Hymn #53 - At the Name of Jesus
Tune: KING'S WESTON
File: elh053.txt

[1] At the name of Jesus
    Ev'ry knee shall bow,
    Ev'ry tongue confess Him
    King of glory now;
    'Tis the Father's pleasure
    We should call Him Lord,
    Who from the beginning
    Was the mighty Word.

[2] Humbled for a season
    To receive a name
    From the lips of sinners
    Unto whom He came,
    Faithfully He bore it
    Spotless to the last,
    Brought it back victorious
    When from death He passed;

[3] Bore it up triumphant
    With its human light,
    Through all ranks of creatures
    To the central height,
    To the throne of Godhead,
    To the Father's breast,
    Filled it with the glory
    Of that perfect rest.

[4] In your hearts enthrone Him;
    There let Him subdue
    All that is not holy,
    All that is not true.
    Crown Him as your Captain
    In temptation's hour;
    Let His will enfold you
    In its light and pow'r.
    Amen
