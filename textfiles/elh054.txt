Tune: SCHONSTER HERR JESU
File: elh054.txt

[1] Beautiful Savior,
    King of creation,
    Son of God and Son of Man!
    Truly I'd love Thee,
    Truly I'd serve Thee,
    Light of my soul, my Joy, my Crown.

[2] Fair are the meadows,
    Fair are the woodlands,
    Robed in flow'rs of blooming spring;
    Jesus is fairer,
    Jesus is purer;
    He makes our sorr'wing spirit sing.

[3] Fair is the sunshine,
    Fair is the moonlight,
    Bright the sparkling stars on high;
    Jesus shines brighter,
    Jesus shines purer
    Than all the angels in the sky.

[4] Beautiful Savior,
    Lord of the nations,
    Son of God and Son of Man!
    Glory and honor,
    Praise, adoration,
    Now and forevermore be Thine!
    Amen
