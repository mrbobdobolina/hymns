File: elh056.txt

[1] Ye lands, to the Lord make a jubilant noise:
    Glory be to God!
    O serve Him with joy, in His presence now rejoice;
    Sing praise unto God out of Zion!

[2] Not we, but the Lord is our Maker, our God:
    Glory be to God!
    His people we are, and the sheep led by His rod;
    Sing praise unto God out of Zion!

[3] O enter His gates with thanksgiving and praise;
    Glory be to God!
    To bless Him and thank Him, our voices we will raise;
    Sing praise unto God out of Zion!

[4] For good is the Lord, and His mercy is sure;
    Glory be to God!
    To all generations His truth shall still endure;
    Sing praise unto God out of Zion!
    Amen
