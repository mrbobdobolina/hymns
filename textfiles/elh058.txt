File: elh058.txt

[1] Give praise to God our King,
    O earth and heaven!
    Of grace and mercy sing,
    So freely given.
    O Savior, who hast died our expiation,
    Thy name be glorified,
    Thy name be glorified,
    By all creation.

[2] O Holy Ghost, our Guide
    To heav'nly glory,
    In all our hearts abide,
    Lord, we implore Thee;
    In us, blest Spirit, reign, Thine aid bestowing;
    Our souls with peace sustain,
    Our souls with peace sustain,
    Peace still o'erflowing.

[3] Lift we our hearts on high
    In adoration;
    Our Lord is ever nigh
    with consolation.
    Let ev'ry grief be still, light He will send us;
    In life, in death, He will
    In life, in death, He will
    Always defend us.
    Amen
