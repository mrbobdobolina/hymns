Hymn #60 - O Bless the Lord, My Soul
Tune: ST. THOMAS
File: elh060.txt

[1] O bless the Lord, my soul!
    Let all within me join
    And aid my tongue to bless His name
    Whose favors are divine.

[2] O bless the Lord, my soul,
    Nor let His mercies lie
    Forgotten in unthankfulness
    And without praises die.

[3] 'Tis He forgives thy sins;
    'Tis He relieves thy pain;
    'Tis He that heals thy sicknesses
    And makes thee young again.

[4] He crowns thy life with love
    When ransomed from the grave;
    He that redeemed my soul from hell
    Hath sov'reign pow'r to save.

[5] He fills the poor with good;
    He gives the suff'rers rest.
    The Lord hath judgments for the proud
    And justice for th' oppressed.

[6] His wondrous works and ways
    He made by Moses known,
    But sent the world His truth and grace
    By His beloved Son.
    Amen
