Hymn #62 - O Love Divine, How Sweet Thou Art
Tune: KOMMT HER ZU MIR
File: elh062.txt

[1] O Love divine, how sweet Thou art!
    When shall I find my longing heart
    All taken up by Thee?
    I thirst, I faint, and die, and prove
    The greatness of redeeming love,
    The love of Christ to me.

[2] Stronger His love than death or hell,
    Its riches are unsearchable;
    The first-born sons of light
    Desire in vain its depth to see;
    They cannot reach the mystery,
    The length, the breadth, the height.

[3] God only knows the love of God,
    And yet He deigns to shed abroad
    His love in my poor heart!
    For love I sigh, for Christ I pine:
    This only portion, Lord, be mine,
    Be mine this better part.

[4] O that I could forever sit
    With Mary at the Master's feet!
    Be this my happy choice!
    My only care, delight, and bliss,
    My joy, my heav'n on earth, be this,
    To hear the Bridegroom's voice.
    Amen
