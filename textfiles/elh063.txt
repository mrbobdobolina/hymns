Tune: NUN DANKET ALLE GOTT
File: elh063.txt

[1] Now thank we all our God
    With hearts and hands and voices,
    Who wondrous things hath done,
    In whom His world rejoices,
    Who from our mother's arms
    Hath blessed us on our way
    With countless gifts of love
    And still is ours today.

[2] O may this bounteous God
    Through all our life be near us,
    With ever joyful hearts
    And blessed peace to cheer us
    And keep us in His grace
    And guide us when perplexed
    And free us from all ills
    In this world and the next.

[3] All praise and thanks to God
    The Father now be given,
    The Son, and Him who reigns
    With them in highest heaven,
    The one eternal God,
    Whom earth and heav'n adore!
    For thus it was, is now,
    And shall be evermore.
    Amen
