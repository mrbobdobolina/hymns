Tune: AUSTRIA
File: elh064.txt

[1] Praise the Lord, ye heav'ns, adore Him,
    Praise Him, angels, in the height;
    Sun and moon, rejoice before Him;
    Praise Him, all ye stars of light.
    Praise the Lord, for He has spoken;
    Worlds His mighty voice obeyed;
    Laws which never shall be broken,
    For their guidance He has made.

[2] Praise the Lord, for He is glorious;
    Never shall His promise fail;
    God has made His saints victorious;
    Sin and death shall not prevail.
    Praise the God of our salvation;
    Hosts on high, His pow'r proclaim;
    Heav'n and earth, and all creation,
    Laud and magnify His name!
    Amen
