Tune: NUN DANKET ALL
File: elh066.txt

[1] Come, let us join our cheerful songs
    With angels round the throne.
    Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
    But all their joys are one.

[2] "Worthy the Lamb that died," they cry,
    "To be exalted thus."
    "Worthy the Lamb," our lips reply,
    "For He was slain for us.

[3] Jesus is worthy to receive
    Honor and pow'r divine;
    And blessings more than we can give
    Be, Lord, forever Thine.

[4] Let all creation join in one
    To bless the sacred name
    Of Him that sits upon the throne
    And to adore the Lamb.
    Amen
