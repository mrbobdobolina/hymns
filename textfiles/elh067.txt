Tune: LAUDA ANIMA
File: elh067.txt

[1] Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;
    To His feet your tribute bring;
    Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
    Evermore His praises sing!
    Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,
    Praise the everlasting King.

[2] Praise Him for His grace and favor
    To His people in distress;
    Praise Him still the same forever,
    Slow to chide and swift to bless.
    Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,
    Glorious in His faithfulness.

[3] Father-like, He tends and spares us;
    Well our feeble frame He knows;
    In His hand He gently bears us,
    Rescues us from all our foes.
    Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,
    Widely yet His mercy flows.

[4] Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish,
    Blows the wind and it is gone;
    But while mortals rise and perish
    God endures unchanging on.
    Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,
    Praise the High Eternal One.

[5] Angels, help us to adore Him,
    Ye behold Him face to face;
    Saints triumphant, bow before Him;
    Gathered in from ev'ry race.
    Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,
    Praise with us the God of grace.
    Amen
