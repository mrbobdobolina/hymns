Hymn #68 - Eternal Son of God
Tune: HERR JESU CHRIST, DICH
File: elh068.txt

[1] Eternal Son of God, O Thou,
    Before whom earth and heaven bow,
    Regard Thy people as they raise
    To Thee their songs of pray'r and praise.

[2] This house they dedicate to Thee,
    That here they may Thy glory see;
    Thy body and Thy blood they here
    Receive, their fainting souls to cheer.

[3] Here in baptismal water pure
    They find for sins a gracious cure;
    Their children here to Thee they bring,
    O Thou, our death-subduing King.

[4] Here sin's diseases healing find,
    The weak grow strong, light cheers the blind;
    The troubled heart with peace is blest,
    And weariness finds heav'nly rest.

[5] When tempests shake the world around,
    The rock-built Church secure is found;
    The gates of hell may here assail
    Whom Christ defends, but not prevail.

[6] Praise to the Father, and the Son,
    And Holy Spirit, Three in One;
    Blest Trinity, whom we adore,
    Teach us to praise Thee evermore.
    Amen
