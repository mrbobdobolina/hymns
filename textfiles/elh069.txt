Tune: YIGDAL
File: elh069.txt

[1] The God of Abr'am praise,
    Who reigns enthroned above;
    Ancient of everlasting days
    And God of love.
    Jehovah, great I Am!
    By earth and heav'n confessed;
    I bow and bless the sacred name
    Forever blest.

[2] The God of Abr'am praise,
    At whose supreme command
    From earth I rise and seek the joys
    At His right hand.
    I all on earth forsake,
    Its wisdom, fame, and pow'r,
    And Him my only portion make,
    My shield and tow'r.

[3] The God of Abr'am praise,
    Whose all-sufficient grace
    Shall guide me all my pilgrim days
    In all my ways.
    He deigns to call me friend;
    He calls Himself my God.
    And He shall save me to the end
    Through Jesus' blood.

[4] He by himself has sworn;
    I on His oath depend.
    I shall, on eagle wings upborne,
    To heav'n ascend.
    I shall behold His face;
    I shall His pow'r adore
    And sing the wonders of His grace
    Forevermore.

[5] Though nature's strength decay,
    And earth and hell withstand,
    To Canaan's bounds I urge my way
    At His command.
    The wat'ry deep I pass,
    With Jesus in my view,
    And through the howling wilderness
    My way pursue.

[6] The goodly land I see,
    With peace and plenty blest;
    A land of sacred liberty
    And endless rest.
    There milk and honey flow.
    And oil and wine abound,
    And trees of life forever grow
    With mercy crowned.

[7] There dwells the Lord our King,
    The Lord our Righteousness,
    Triumphant o'er the world and sin,
    The Prince of Peace.
    On Zion's sacred height
    His kingdom He maintains
    And glorious with His saints in light
    Forever reigns.

[8] The God who reigns on high
    The great archangels sing,
    And "Holy, holy, holy!" cry,
    "Almighty King!
    Who was and is the same
    And evermore shall be:
    Jehovah, Father, great I Am!
    We worship Thee!"

[9] The whole triumphant host
    Give thanks to God on high.
    "Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!"
    They ever cry.
    Hail, Abr'am's God and mine!
    I join the heav'nly lays:
    All might and majesty are Thine
    And endless praise!
    Amen
