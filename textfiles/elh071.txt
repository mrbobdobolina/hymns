Tune: ALLEIN GOTT IN DER HOH
File: elh071.txt

[1] The Lord hath helped me hitherto
    By His surpassing favor;
    His mercies ev'ry morn were new,
    His kindness did not waver.
    God hitherto hath been my Guide,
    Hath pleasures hitherto supplied,
    And hitherto hath helped me.

[2] I praise and thank Thee, Lord, my God,
    For Thine abundant blessing
    Which heretofore Thou hast bestowed
    And I am still possessing.
    Inscribe this on my memory:
    The Lord hath done great things for me
    And graciously hath helped me.

[3] Help me henceforth, O God of grace,
    Help me on each occasion,
    Help me in each and ev'ry place,
    Help me through Jesus' Passion.
    Help me in life and death, O God,
    Help me through Jesus' dying blood;
    Help me as Thou hast helped me.
    Amen
