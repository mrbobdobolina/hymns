Tune: JUDAS MACCABAEUS
File: elh073.txt

[1] Thine is the glory,
    Risen, conqu'ring Son;
    Endless is the vict'ry
    Thou o'er death hast won!
    Angels in bright raiment
    Rolled the stone away,
    Kept the folded grave-clothes
    Where Thy body lay.

[Refrain] Thine is the glory,
          Risen, conqu'ring Son;
          Endless is the vict'ry
          Thou o'er death hast won!

[2] Lo, Jesus meets thee,
    Risen from the tomb!
    Lovingly He greets thee,
    Scatters fear and gloom;
    Let His Church with gladness
    Hymns of triumph sing,
    For the Lord now liveth;
    Death hath lost its sting!

[Refrain] Thine is the glory,
          Risen, conqu'ring Son;
          Endless is the vict'ry
          Thou o'er death hast won!

[3] Faith's hand doth touch Thee,
    Glorious Prince of life;
    Life is nought without Thee;
    Aid us in our strife;
    Make us more than conqu'rors,
    Through Thy deathless love;
    Bring us through death's portals
    To Thy home above.

[Refrain] Thine is the glory,
          Risen, conqu'ring Son;
          Endless is the vict'ry
          Thou o'er death hast won!
          Amen
