Hymn #75 - Come, Thou Bright and Morning Star
Tune: MORGENGLANZ DER EWIGKEIT
File: elh075.txt

[1] Come, Thou bright and Morning Star,
    Light of light, without beginning!
    Shine upon us from afar
    That we may be kept from sinning.
    Drive away, by Thy clear light,
    Our dark night.

[2] Let Thy grace, like morning dew
    Falling soft on barren places,
    Comfort, quicken, and renew
    Our dry souls and dying graces;
    Bless Thy flock from Thy rich store
    Evermore.

[3] May Thy fervent love destroy
    Our cold works, in us awaking
    Ardent zeal and holy joy
    At the purple morn's first breaking.
    Let us truly rise ere yet
    Life has set.

[4] Thou who hast gone upon high,
    Grant that, at Thy trumpet soundeth,
    When with glory, in the sky,
    Thee Thy cloud of saints surroundeth,
    We may stand among Thine own,
    Round Thy throne.

[5] Light us to the golden shore,
    O Thou rising Sun of morning!
    Lead where tears shall flow no more,
    Where all sighs to songs are turning,
    Where Thy glory sheds alway
    Perfect day.
    Amen
