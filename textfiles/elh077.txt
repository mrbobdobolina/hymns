Hymn #77 - God, Who Madest Earth and Heaven
Tune: GOTT DES HIMMELS
File: elh077.txt

[1] God, who madest earth and heaven,
    Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
    Who the day and night hast given,
    Sun and moon and starry host;
    Whose almighty hand sustains
    Earth and all that it contains:

[2] God, I thank Thee, in Thy keeping
    Safely have I slumbered here;
    Thou hast guarded me while sleeping
    From all danger, pain, and fear;
    And the cunning evil foe
    Hath not wrought my overthrow.

[3] Let the night of my transgression
    With night's darkness pass away.
    Jesus, into Thy possession
    I resign myself today;
    In Thy wounds I find relief
    From all sorrow, sin, and grief.

[4] Help me as the morn is breaking,
    In the spirit to arise,
    So from careless sloth awaking,
    That, when o'er the aged skies
    Shall the Judgment Day appear,
    I may see it without fear.

[5] Lead me, and forsake me never,
    Guide my wand'rings by Thy Word;
    As Thou hast been, be Thou ever
    My Defense, my Refuge, Lord.
    Never safe except with Thee,
    Thou my faithful Guardian be.

[6] O my God, I now commend me
    Wholly to Thy mighty hand;
    All the pow'rs that Thou dost lend me
    Let me use at Thy command.
    Lord, my Shield, my Strength divine,
    Keep me with Thee, I am Thine.

[7] From the evil one's dark power
    Let Thine angel guard my soul;
    Warning, guiding me each hour,
    All the devil's wiles control
    Till my final rest be come,
    And Thine angel bear me home.
    Amen
