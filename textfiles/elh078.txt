Tune: DIE HELLE SONN LEUCHT
File: elh078.txt

[1] The radiant sun shines in the skies,
    With joy from sleep we now arise.
    All praise to God, who through this night
    Hath kept us from the devil's might.

[2] Lord Jesus Christ, guide us this day,
    Keep sin and shame far from our way.
    Thy guardian angels to us send
    And let them to our wants attend.

[3] Direct our hearts to do Thy will
    And for Thy Word true love instill
    That we may do whate'er is right
    And ever pleasing in Thy sight.

[4] Crown all our labors with success,
    Each one in his own calling bless.
    May all we do or think or say
    Exalt and praise Thee, Lord, this day!
    Amen
