Hymn #79 - My Inmost Heart Now Raises
Tune: AUS MEINES HERZENS GRUNDE
File: elh079.txt

[1] My inmost heart now raises
    In this fair morning hour
    A song of thankful praises
    To Thine almighty pow'r,
    O God, upon Thy throne.
    To honor and adore Thee,
    I bring my praise before Thee
    Through Christ, Thine only Son.

[2] For Thou from me hast warded
    All perils of the night;
    From ev'ry harm hast guarded
    My soul till morning light.
    To Thee I humbly cry,
    O Savior, have compassion
    And pardon my transgression;
    Have mercy, Lord most high!

[3] And shield me from all evil,
    O gracious God, this day,
    From sin, and from the devil,
    From shame and from dismay,
    From fire's consuming breath,
    From water's devastation,
    From need and consternation,
    From evil sudden death.

[4] Let not Thine angel leave me
    While here on earth I stay
    Lest Satan's arts deceive me
    And lead my soul astray.
    Then keep Thine angel near
    At night and each new morrow
    Lest soul and body sorrow
    And falt'ring cost me dear.
    Amen
