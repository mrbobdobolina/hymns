Tune: O HEILIGE DREIFALTIGKEIT
File: elh080.txt

[1] O blessed, Holy Trinity,
    Divine, eternal Unity,
    God Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
    Be Thou this day my Guide and Host.

[2] My soul and body keep from harm;
    O'er all I have extend Thine arm,
    That Satan may not cause distress
    Nor bring me shame and wretchedness.

[3] The Father's love shield me this day,
    The Son's pure wisdom cheer my way;
    The Holy Spirit's light divine
    Illume my heart's benighted shrine.

[4] My Maker, strengthen Thou my heart;
    O my Redeemer, help impart,
    Blest Comforter, keep at my side
    That faith and love in me abide.

[5] Lord, bless and keep Thou me as Thine;
    Lord, make Thy face upon me shine;
    Lord, lift Thy countenance on me
    And give me peace, sweet peace, from Thee.
    Amen
