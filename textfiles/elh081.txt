Tune: O HEILIGE DREIFALTIGKEIT
File: elh081.txt

[1] O Splendor of God's glory bright,
    Who bringest forth the light from Light;
    O Light of light, light's Fountain-spring;
    O Day, our days enlightening.

[2] Come, very Sun of truth and love,
    Come in Thy radiance from above
    And shed the Holy Spirit's ray
    On all we think or do today.

[3] Likewise to Thee our prayers ascend,
    Father of glory without end,
    Father of saving grace, for pow'r
    To conquer in temptation's hour.

[4] Teach us to work with all our might;
    Beat back the devil's threat'ning spite;
    Turn all to good that seems most ill;
    Help us our calling to fulfil.

[5] Direct and govern heart and mind,
    With body chaste and disciplined;
    Let faith her eager fires renew
    And hate the false and love the true.

[6] On Christ, the true Bread, let us feed,
    Let Him to us be drink indeed,
    And let us taste with joyfulness
    The Holy Spirit's plenteousness.

[7] O joyful be the livelong day,
    Our thoughts as pure as morning ray,
    Our faith like noonday's glowing height,
    Our souls undimmed by shades of night.

[8] The dawn begins to speed her way,
    Let the true Dawn Himself display,
    The Son with God the Father One,
    And God the Father in the Son.

[9] All praise to God the Father be,
    All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
    Whom with the Spirit we adore
    Forever and forevermore.
    Amen
