Hymn #83 - The Sun Arises Now
Tune: NU RINDER SOLEN OP
File: elh083.txt

[1] The sun arises now
    With rays most tender,
    It paints the mountain brow
    With rosy splendor.
    In faith, my soul, now lift
    your voice in singing
    To God, your gladness show,
    Your heart with joy aglow
    And praises ringing.

[2] Like countless grains of sand
    Beyond all measure,
    And wide as sea and land
    Is heaven's treasure
    Of grace, which God anew
    each day will give us,
    For like a gentle rain,
    Our lives of sinful stain
    Each morning bathes us.

[3] God has throughout the night
    My bed surrounded
    With angel hosts of light
    And pow'r unbounded;
    So I in calm did rest
    in peaceful slumber
    Until from deep repose
    The light again arose
    From darkness somber.

[4] Lord, keep my soul today
    From sin and blindness;
    Surround me on my way
    With loving-kindness
    And fill my heart, O God,
    with joy from heaven;
    I then shall ask no more.
    My future is secure,
    By Wisdom given.

[5] Lord, You know best my needs,
    My pains You're sharing;
    Your Word and grace now feeds
    The lamb You're bearing.
    What more could I desire
    with You deciding
    The course which I now take?
    I follow in the wake
    Where You are guiding!
    Amen
