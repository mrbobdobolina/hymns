Tune: FRED TIL BOD (LINDEMAN)
File: elh084.txt

[1] Jesus, Sun of righteousness,
    Brightest beam of love divine,
    With the early morning rays
    Do Thou on our darkness shine,
    And dispel with purest light
    All our long and gloomy night.

[2] Like the sun's reviving ray,
    May Thy love, with tender glow,
    All our coldness melt away,
    Warm and cheer us forth to go,
    Thee to honor and obey
    All our life's short earthly day.

[3] Thou our only Hope and Guide,
    Never leave us nor forsake:
    In Thy light may we abide
    Till the endless morning break,
    Moving to Thy holy hill
    Onward, upward, homeward still.

[4] Lead us all our days and years
    In Thy straight and narrow way;
    Lead us through this vale of tears
    To the land of perfect day,
    Where Thy people, fully blest,
    Near Thy throne forever rest.
    Amen
