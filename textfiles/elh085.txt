Hymn #85 - When Morning Gilds the Skies
Tune: LAUDES DOMINI
File: elh085.txt

[1] When morning gilds the skies,
    My heart, awaking, cries,
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"
    Alike at work and prayer,
    To Jesus I repair;
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

[2] The night becomes as day
    When from the heart we say,
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"
    The pow'rs of darkness fear
    When this sweet chant they hear:
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

[3] Ye nations of mankind,
    In this their concord find:
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"
    Let all the earth around
    Ring joyous with the sound:
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

[4] To God, the Word, on High,
    The hosts of angels cry,
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"
    Let mortals, too, upraise
    Their voice in hymns of praise:
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

[5] In heav'n's eternal bliss
    The loveliest strain is this:
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"
    Let air and sea and sky
    From depth to height reply:
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"

[6] Be this, while life is mine,
    My canticle divine:
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"
    Be this th' eternal song
    Though all the ages long:
    "May Jesus Christ be praised!"
    Amen
