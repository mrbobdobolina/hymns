Hymn #86 - While Yet the Morn Is Breaking
Tune: ACH GOTT VOM HIMMELREICHE
File: elh086.txt

[1] While yet the morn is breaking
    I thank my God once more,
    Beneath whose care awaking,
    I find the night is o'er;
    I thank Him that He calls me
    To life and health anew;
    To life whate'er befalls me,
    His care will still be true.

[2] O Israel's Guardian, hear me,
    Watch over me this day;
    In all I do be near me,
    For others, too, I pray;
    To Thee I would commend them,
    Our Church, our school, our land,
    Direct them and defend them,
    When dangers are at hand.

[3] O gracious Lord, direct us,
    Thy doctrine pure defend,
    From heresies protect us,
    And for Thy Word contend,
    That we may praise Thee ever,
    O God, with one accord,
    And say: The Lord, our Savior,
    Be evermore adored!

[4] O grant us peace and gladness,
    Give us our daily bread,
    Shield us from grief and sadness,
    On us Thy blessings shed.
    Grant that our whole behavior,
    In truth and righteousness,
    May praise Thee, Lord, our Savior,
    Whose holy name we bless.

[5] And gently grant Thy blessing
    That we may do Thy will,
    No more Thy ways transgressing,
    Our proper task fulfill;
    With Peter's full assurance
    Let down our nets again.
    Success will crown endurance
    If faithful we remain.

[6] With craftiness unceasing
    Strives Satan to restrain
    What in Thy sight is pleasing
    And for Thy Church is gain;
    Yet vain is his endeavor,
    For Thou, O Christ, our Lord,
    Dost rule all things forever
    By Thine almighty Word.

[7] Thou art the Vine; O nourish
    The branches graft in Thee,
    And let them grow and flourish,
    A fair and fruitful tree.
    Thy Spirit pour within us,
    And let His gifts of grace
    To such good actions win us
    As best may show Thy praise.
    Amen
