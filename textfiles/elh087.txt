Tune: STUTTGART
File: elh087.txt

[1] Come, Thou long-expected Jesus,
    Born to set Thy people free;
    From our fears and sins release us,
    Let us find our rest in Thee.

[2] Israel's Strength and Consolation,
    Hope of all the earth Thou art,
    Dear Desire of ev'ry nation,
    Joy of ev'ry longing heart.

[3] Born Thy people to deliver,
    Born a Child and yet a King,
    Born to reign in us forever,
    Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.

[4] By Thine own eternal Spirit
    Rule Thou in our hearts alone;
    By thine all sufficient merit
    Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
    Amen
