File: elh088.txt

[1] Come, Thou precious Ransom, come,
    Only Hope for sinful mortals!
    Come, O Savior of the world!
    Open are to Thee all portals.
    Come, Thy beauty let us see;
    Anxiously we wait for Thee.

[2] Enter now my waiting heart,
    Glorious King and Lord most holy.
    Dwell in me and ne'er depart,
    Though I am but poor and lowly.
    Ah, what riches will be mine
    When Thou art my Guest divine!

[3] My hosannas and my palms
    Graciously receive, I pray Thee.
    Evermore, as best I can,
    Savior, I will homage pay Thee,
    And in faith I will embrace,
    Lord, Thy merit through Thy grace.

[4] Hail, hosanna, David's Son!
    Help, Lord; hear our supplication!
    Let Thy kingdom, scepter, crown,
    Bring us blessing and salvation
    That forever we may sing:
    Hail! Hosanna to our King!
    Amen
