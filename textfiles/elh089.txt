Hymn #89 - Jesus Came, the Heavens Adoring
Tune: SIEH, HIER BIN ICH
File: elh089.txt

[1] Jesus came, the heav'ns adoring,
    Came with peace from realms on high;
    Jesus came for man's redemption,
    Lowly came on earth to die,
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    Came in deep humility.

[2] Jesus comes again in mercy
    When our hearts are bowed with care;
    Jesus comes again in answer
    To a faithful, trusting prayer,
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    Comes to save us from despair.

[3] Jesus comes to hearts rejoicing,
    Bringing news of sins forgiv'n;
    Jesus comes in sounds of gladness,
    Leading souls redeemed to heav'n.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    Now the gate of death is riv'n.

[4] Jesus comes in joy and sorrow,
    Shares alike our hopes and fears;
    Jesus comes, whate'er befalls us,
    Glads our hearts, and dries our tears;
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    Cheering e'en our failing years.

[5] Jesus comes on clouds triumphant
    When the heav'ns shall pass away.
    Jesus comes again in glory;
    Let us, then, our homage pay,
    "Alleluia" ever singing
    Till the dawn of endless day.
    Amen
