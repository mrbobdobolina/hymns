File: elh090.txt

[1] Savior of the nations, come;
    Virgin's Son, make here Thy home!
    Marvel now, O heav'n and earth,
    That the Lord chose such a birth.

[2] Not by human flesh and blood,
    By the Spirit of our God
    Was the Word of God made flesh--
    Woman's Offspring, pure and fresh.

[3] Wondrous birth! O wondrous Child
    Of the Virgin undefiled!
    Though by all the world disowned,
    Still to be in heav'n enthroned.

[4] From the Father forth He came
    And returneth to the same,
    Captive leading death and hell--
    High the song of triumph swell!

[5] Thou, the Father's only Son,
    Hast o'er sin the vict'ry won.
    Boundless shall Thy kingdom be;
    When shall we its glories see?

[6] Brightly doth Thy manger shine,
    Glorious is its light divine.
    Let not sin o'ercloud this light;
    Ever be our faith thus bright.

[7] Praise to God the Father sing,
    Praise to God the Son, our King,
    Praise to God the Spirit be
    Ever and eternally.
    Amen
