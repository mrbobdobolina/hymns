File: elh092.txt

[1] Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!
    Behold, the King of Glory waits;
    The King of kings is drawing near,
    The Savior of the world is here.
    Life and salvation He doth bring;
    Wherefore rejoice and gladly sing:
    We praise Thee, Father, now,
    Creator, wise art Thou!

[2] A Helper just He comes to thee,
    His chariot is humility,
    His kingly crown is holiness,
    His scepter, pity in distress.
    The end of all our woe He brings;
    Wherefore the earth is glad and sings:
    We praise Thee, Savior, now,
    Mighty in deed art Thou!

[3] O blest the land, the city blest,
    Where Christ the Ruler is confessed!
    O happy hearts and happy homes
    To whom this King in triumph comes!
    The cloudless Sun of joy He is,
    Who bringeth pure delight and bliss.
    We praise Thee, Spirit, now,
    Our Comforter art Thou!

[4] Fling wide the portals of your heart;
    Prepare a temple set apart
    From earthly use for heav'n's employ,
    Adorned with prayer and love and joy.
    For lo, your Savior and your King
    Salvation, life, and peace doth bring.
    To Thee, O God, be praise
    For word and deed and grace!

[5] Redeemer, come! and open wide
    My heart to Thee; here, Lord, abide!
    Let me Thy gracious presence feel,
    Thy peace and love to all reveal;
    Thy Holy Spirit guide us on
    Until our glorious goal is won.
    Eternal praise and fame
    We offer to Thy name.
    Amen
