Tune: GELOBET SEIST DU
File: elh093.txt

[1] The new church year again is come
    And wakes the joy of Christendom;
    Thy King, O Zion, comes to thee,
    Rejoice, rejoice eternally.
    Have mercy, O Lord!

[2] Now in our midst anew are heard
    The lessons of God's holy Word
    That lead the way to life and heav'n;
    Lord, praise to Thee for this be giv'n.
    Have mercy, O Lord!

[3] Thy truth repeated o'er and o'er
    Our faith will strengthen more and more;
    Let it abide in us, that we
    May join in endless praise to Thee.
    Have mercy, O Lord!
    Amen
