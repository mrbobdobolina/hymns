Tune: WIE SOLL ICH DICH EMPFANGEN
File: elh094.txt

[1] O how shall I receive Thee,
    How welcome Thee aright!
    All nations long to greet Thee,
    My hope, my heart's delight!
    O Jesus, Jesus, set Thee
    Thy lamp within my breast,
    And by its guidance let me
    Know what doth please Thee best.

[2] Thy Zion stews before Thee
    Green boughs and fairest palms,
    And I, too, will adore Thee
    With sweetest songs and psalms.
    My heart shall bloom forever
    For Thee with praises new,
    And from Thy name shall never
    Withhold the honor due.

[3] What hast Thou left ungranted
    To give me glad relief?
    When soul and body panted
    In utmost depth of grief,
    In deepest degradation,
    Devoid of joy and peace,
    Then, Thou, my soul's Salvation,
    Didst come to bring release.

[4] I lay in fetters groaning,
    Thou com'st to set me free;
    I stood, my shame bemoaning,
    Thou com'st to honor me;
    A glory Thou dost give me,
    A treasure safe on high,
    That will not fail or leave me
    As earthly riches fly.

[5] Naught, naught, dear Lord, could move Thee
    To leave Thy rightful place
    Save love, for which I love Thee;
    A love that could embrace
    A world where sorrow dwelleth,
    Which sin and suff'ring fill,
    More than the tongue's e'er telleth;
    Yet Thou couldst love it still!

[6] Rejoice, then, ye sad-hearted,
    Who sit in deepest gloom,
    Who mourn o'er joys departed,
    And tremble at your doom;
    Despair not, He is near you,
    Yea, standing at the door,
    Who best can help and cheer you,
    And bid you weep no more.

[7] No care nor effort either
    Is needed day or night,
    How ye may draw Him hither
    In your own strength and might.
    He comes, He comes with gladness,
    Moved by His love alone,
    To calm your fear and sadness,
    To Him they well are known.

[8] Sin's debt, that fearful burden,
    Let not your souls distress;
    Your guilt the Lord will pardon
    And cover with His grace.
    He comes, He comes procuring
    The peace of sin forgiv'n,
    For all God's sons securing
    Their heritage in heav'n.

[9] Why should the wicked move you?
    Heed not their craft and spite!
    Your Savior who doth love you
    Will scatter all their might.
    He comes, a King most glorious,
    And all His earthly foes
    In vain His course victorious
    Endeavor to oppose.

[10] He comes to judge the nations,
     A terror to His foes,
     A Light of consolations
     And blessed Hope to those
     Who love the Lord's appearing.
     O glorious Sun, now come,
     Send forth Thy beams so cheering,
     And guide us safely home!
     Amen
