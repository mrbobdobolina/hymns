Tune: OP, THI DAGEN NU FREMBRYDER
File: elh095.txt

[1] Wake! the welcome day appeareth,
    How with joy our hearts it cheereth!
    Wake, the Lord's great year behold!
    That which holy men of old,
    Those who throng the sacred pages,
    Waited for through countless ages;
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

[2] Patriarchs and priests aspiring,
    Kings and prophets long desiring,
    Saw not this before they died:
    Lo, the sight to them denied!
    See His beams to earth directed!
    Welcome, O Thou long-expected!
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

[3] He, the Savior sent by heaven,
    Once through faith to Abram given,
    Israel's Son and glorious King,
    Hope to which the Gentiles cling,
    Now on earth with men abiding,
    Come to Zion meekly riding;
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

[4] Lo! He comes, a victim willing,
    All His Father's will fulfilling;
    He will, through His precious blood,
    All things once again make good,
    Pain and shame of death sustaining,
    What was lost with joy regaining;
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

[5] In our stead Himself He offers,
    On the cursed tree He suffers,
    That His death's sweet savor may
    Take our curse for aye away,
    Cross and curse for us enduring,
    Hope and heav'n to us securing;
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

[6] Moses' law no longer rules us,
    Christ's free Spirit gently schools us;
    Ended now our captive thrall;
    He who heeds God's gracious call,
    Through his Savior's death and merit,
    Now enjoys adoption's spirit;
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

[7] Rent the temple curtain's center,
    Fearless we may boldly enter,
    Through the veil, the holy place,
    There to stand before His face;
    He who once came down from heaven,
    Fear from all our breasts hath driven;
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

[8] Hence thy King, O Zion, praising,
    Heart and voice to Him upraising,
    Shout with joy, thou royal heir
    In His kingdom thou wilt share;
    Come, thyself as off'ring bringing,
    Come, thou Bride, forever singing
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    Amen
