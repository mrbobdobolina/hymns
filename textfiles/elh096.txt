Hymn #96 - Hark, a Thrilling Voice Is Sounding!
Tune: MERTON
File: elh096.txt

[1] Hark, a thrilling voice is sounding!
    "Christ is nigh!" we hear it say.
    "Cast away the works of darkness;
    O ye children of the day!"

[2] Wakened by the solemn warning,
    Let the earthbound soul arise;
    All the pow'rs of darkness vanish;
    Christ, our Daystar, mounts the skies.

[3] Lo, the Lamb, so long-expected,
    Comes with pardon down from heav'n.
    Let us haste, with tears of sorrow,
    One and all, to be forgiv'n.

[4] That, when next He comes with glory
    And the world is wrapped in fear,
    He may shield us with His mercy
    And with words of love draw near.

[5] Honor, glory, might, dominion
    To the Father and the Son
    With the everliving Spirit
    While eternal ages run!
    Amen
