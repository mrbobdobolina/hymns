Hymn #98 - Lo! He Comes with Clouds Descending
Tune: HELMSLEY
File: elh098.txt

[1] Lo! He comes with clouds descending,
    Once for our salvation slain;
    Thousand thousand saints attending
    Swell the triumph of His train:
    Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
    Christ reveals His endless reign.

[2] Ev'ry eye shall now behold Him
    Robed in dreadful majesty;
    Those who set at nought and sold Him,
    Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
    Deeply wailing, deeply wailing, deeply wailing,
    Shall the true Messiah see.

[3] Those dear tokens of His Passion
    Still His dazzling body bears,
    Cause of endless exultation
    To His ransomed worshipers.
    With what rapture, with what rapture, with what rapture
    Gaze we on those glorious scars!

[4] Yea, amen, let all adore Thee,
    High on Thine eternal throne;
    Savior, take the pow'r and glory,
    Claim the kingdom as Thine own.
    O come quickly, O come quickly, O come quickly!
    Alleluia! Come, Lord, come!
    Amen
