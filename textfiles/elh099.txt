Hymn #99 - The Advent of Our King
Tune: ST. THOMAS
File: elh099.txt

[1] The advent of our King
    Our pray'rs must now employ,
    And we must hymns of welcome sing
    In strains of holy joy.

[2] The everlasting Son
    Incarnate deigns to be;
    Himself a servant's form puts on
    To set His servants free.

[3] O Zion's Daughter, rise
    To meet thy lowly King;
    Repentant hearts He'll not despise,
    Forgiveness He doth bring.

[4] As Judge, on clouds of light,
    He soon will come again;
    Then saints and angels will unite
    To praise His heav'nly reign.

[5] Before the dawning day
    Let sin's dark deeds be gone,
    The old man all be put away,
    The new man all put on.

[6] All glory to the Son,
    Who comes to set us free,
    With Father, Spirit, ever One,
    Through all eternity.
    Amen
