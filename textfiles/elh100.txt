Tune: ACH GOTT VOM HIMMELREICHE
File: elh100.txt

[1] The Bridegroom soon will call us:
    Come, all ye wedding guests!
    May not His voice appal us
    While slumber binds our breasts!
    May all our lamps be burning
    And oil be found in store
    That we, with Him returning,
    May open find the door!

[2] There shall we see delighted
    Our dear Redeemer's face,
    Who leads our souls benighted
    To glory by His grace.
    The patriarchs shall meet us,
    The prophets' holy band,
    Apostles, martyrs greet us
    In that celestial land.

[3] They will not blush to own us
    As brothers, sisters dear;
    Love ever will be shown us
    When we with them appear.
    We all shall come before Him
    Who for us Man became,
    As Lord and God adore Him,
    And ever bless His name.

[4] Our Father, rich in blessing,
    Will give us crowns of gold
    And, to His bosom pressing,
    Impart a bliss untold,
    Will welcome with embraces
    Of never-ending love,
    And deck us with His graces
    In blissful realms above.

[5] In yonder home shall never
    Be silent music's voice;
    With hearts and lips forever
    We shall in God rejoice.
    The angels shall adore Him,
    All saints shall sing His praise
    And bring with joy before Him
    Their sweetest heavenly lays.

[6] In mansions fair and spacious
    Will God the feast prepare
    And, ever kind and gracious,
    Bid us its riches share.
    There bliss that knows no measure
    From springs of love shall flow,
    And never-changing pleasure
    His bounty will bestow.

[7] Thus God shall from all evil
    Forever make us free,
    From sin and from the devil,
    From all adversity,
    From sickness, pain, and sadness,
    From troubles, cares, and fears,
    And grant us heav'nly gladness
    And wipe away our tears.
    Amen
