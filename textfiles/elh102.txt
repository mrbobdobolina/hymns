Hymn #102 - Comfort, Comfort Ye My People
Tune: FREU DICH SEHR
File: elh102.txt

[1] "Comfort, comfort, ye My people,
    Speak ye peace," thus saith our God.
    "Comfort those who sit in darkness,
    Mourning 'neath their sorrows' load.
    Speak ye to Jerusalem
    Of the peace that waits for them;
    Tell her that her sins I cover
    And her warfare now is over."

[2] Yea, her sins our God will pardon,
    Blotting out each dark misdeed;
    All that well deserved His anger
    He no more will see or heed.
    She hath suffered many a day;
    Now her griefs have passed away.
    God will change her pining sadness
    Into ever-springing gladness.

[3] Hark, the herald's voice is crying
    In the desert far and near,
    Bidding all men to repentance,
    Since the Kingdom now is here.
    O that warning cry obey!
    Now prepare for God away;
    Let the valleys rise to meet Him
    And the hills bow down to greet Him.

[4] Make ye straight what long was crooked;
    Make the rougher places plain.
    Let your hearts be true and humble
    As befits His holy reign.
    For the glory of the Lord
    Now o'er earth is shed abroad,
    And all flesh shall see the token
    That His Word is never broken.
    Amen
