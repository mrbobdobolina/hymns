Tune: AUF MEINEN LIEBEN GOTT
File: elh104.txt

[1] O Bride of Christ, rejoice!
    Exultant raise thy voice
    To hail the day of glory
    Foretold in sacred story.
    Hosanna, praise, and glory,
    Our King, we bow before Thee.

[2] Let shouts of gladness rise
    Triumphant to the skies.
    Here comes the King most glorious
    To reign o'er all victorious.
    Hosanna, praise, and glory,
    Our King, we bow before Thee.

[3] He wears no kingly crown,
    Yet as a King He's known;
    Though not arrayed in splendor,
    He still makes death surrender.
    Hosanna, praise, and glory,
    Our King, we bow before Thee.

[4] The weak and timid find
    Him gentle, good, and kind;
    To them He gives a treasure
    Of bliss beyond all measure.
    Hosanna, praise, and glory,
    Our King, we bow before Thee.

[5] Thy heart now open wide,
    Bid Christ with thee abide;
    He graciously will hear thee,
    And be forever near thee.
    Hosanna, praise, and glory,
    Our King, we bow before Thee.

[6] Then go thy Lord to meet,
    Strew palm-leaves at His feet;
    Thy garments spread before Him
    And honor and adore Him.
    Hosanna, praise, and glory,
    Our King, we bow before Thee.

[7] E'en babes with one accord
    With thee shall praise the Lord,
    And ev'ry Gentile nation
    Respond with exultation.
    Hosanna, praise, and glory,
    Our King, we bow before Thee.
    Amen
