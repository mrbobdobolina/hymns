Tune: AUS MEINES HERZENS GRUNDE
File: elh105.txt

[1] Rise, children of the kingdom!
    The King is drawing nigh.
    Arise, and hail with gladness
    The Ruler from on high.
    Ye Christians, hasten forth!
    Your praise and homage bring Him
    And glad Hosannas sing Him;
    Naught else your love is worth.

[2] Arise, ye drooping mourners!
    The King is very near.
    Away with grief and sorrow,
    For lo! your help is here.
    Behold, in many a place--
    O blessed consolation--
    We find Him, our salvation,
    In His pure means of grace.

[3] Arise, ye much afflicted!
    The King is not afar.
    Rejoice, ye long dejected!
    Behold the Morning Star.
    The Lord will give you joy,
    Though troubles now distress you,
    With comfort He will bless you,
    E'en death He will destroy.

[4] Arise, ye poor and needy!
    The King provides for you.
    He comes with succor speedy,
    With mercy ever new.
    Receive your gracious King,
    The giver of all blessing.
    Hail Him, His name confessing,
    And glad Hosannas sing.

[5] O rich the gifts Thou bring'st us,
    Thyself made poor and weak;
    O love beyond expression,
    That thus can sinners seek!
    For this, O Lord, will we
    Our joyous tribute bring Thee,
    And glad Hosannas sing Thee,
    And ever grateful be.
    Amen
