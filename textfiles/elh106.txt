Hymn #106 - On Jordan's Bank the Herald's Cry
Tune: PUER NOBIS
File: elh106.txt

[1] On Jordan's bank the herald's cry
    Announces that the Lord is nigh;
    Awake and hearken, for he brings
    Glad tidings of the King of kings.

[2] Then cleansed be ev'ry Christian breast,
    And furnished for so great a Guest;
    Yea, let us each our hearts prepare
    For Christ to come and enter there.

[3] For Thou art our Salvation, Lord,
    Our Refuge and our great Reward;
    Without Thy grace we waste away,
    Like flow'rs that wither and decay.

[4] To heal the sick stretch out Thine hand
    And bid the fallen sinner stand;
    Once more upon thy people shine
    And fill the world with love divine.

[5] All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
    Whose advent set Thy people free:
    Whom with the Father we adore
    And Holy Ghost, for evermore.
    Amen
