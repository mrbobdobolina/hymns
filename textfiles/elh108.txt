Hymn #108 - Creator of the Starry Height
Tune: CONDITOR ALME SIDERUM
File: elh108.txt

[1] Creator of the starry height,
    Thy people's everlasting light,
    O Christ, Redeemer of us all,
    Hear Thou Thy servants when they call.

[2] Thou, sorr'wing at the helpless cry
    Of all creation doomed to die,
    Didst save our lost and guilty race
    By healing gifts of heav'nly grace.

[3] Love drew Thee down the world to win
    From common stain of common sin;
    Proceeding from a virgin shrine
    The spotless victim all divine.

[4] At Thy great name, exalted now,
    All knees in lowly homage bow;
    All things in heav'n and earth adore,
    And own Thee King forevermore.

[5] To Thee, O holy One, we pray,
    Our Judge in that tremendous day;
    Ward off, while yet we dwell below,
    The weapons of our crafty foe.

[6] To God the Father, God the Son,
    And God the Spirit, Three in One,
    Praise, honor, might, and glory be
    From age to age eternally.
    Amen
