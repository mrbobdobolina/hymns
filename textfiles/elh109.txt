Hymn #109 - Hark the Glad Sound! The Savior Comes
Tune: CHESTERFIELD
File: elh109.txt

[1] Hark the glad sound! The Savior comes,
    The Savior promised long;
    Let ev'ry heart prepare a throne
    And ev'ry voice a song.

[2] He comes the pris'ners to release,
    In Satan's bondage held.
    The gates of brass before Him burst,
    The iron fetters yield.

[3] He comes the broken heart to bind,
    The bleeding soul to cure,
    And with the treasures of His grace
    To enrich the humble poor.

[4] Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
    Thy welcome shall proclaim,
    And heav'n's eternal arches ring
    With Thy beloved name.
    Amen
