File: elh110.txt

[1] O come, O come, Emmanuel,
    And ransom captive Israel,
    That mourns in lonely exile here,
    Until the Son of God appear.

[Refrain] Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
          Shall come to thee, O Israel.

[2] O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
    Who ord'rest all things mightily;
    To us the path of knowledge show
    And teach us in her ways to go.

[Refrain] Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
          Shall come to thee, O Israel.

[3] O come, O come, Thou Lord of might,
    Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height
    In ancient times didst give the law
    In cloud, and majesty, and awe.

[Refrain] Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
          Shall come to thee, O Israel.

[4] O come, Thou Rod of Jesse's stem;
    From ev'ry foe deliver them
    That trust Thy mighty pow'r to save,
    And give them vict'ry o'er the grave.

[Refrain] Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
          Shall come to thee, O Israel.

[5] O come, Thou Key of David, come,
    And open wide our heav'nly home;
    Make safe the way that leads on high,
    And close the path to misery.

[Refrain] Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
          Shall come to thee, O Israel.

[6] O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer
    Our spirits by Thine advent here;
    Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
    And death's dark shadows put to flight.

[Refrain] Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
          Shall come to thee, O Israel.

[7] O come, Desire of nations, bind
    All peoples in one heart and mind;
    Bid Thou our sad divisions cease,
    And be Thyself our King of Peace.

[Refrain] Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
          Shall come to thee, O Israel.
          Amen
