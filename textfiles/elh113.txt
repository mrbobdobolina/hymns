Hymn #113 - A Great and Mighty Wonder
Tune: ES IST EIN ROS
File: elh113.txt

[1] A great and mighty wonder,
    A full and holy cure:
    The Virgin bears the Infant
    With virgin honor pure!

[Refrain] Repeat the hymn again:
          "To God on high be glory
          And peace on earth to men!"

[2] The Word becomes incarnate
    And yet remains on high,
    And cherubim sing anthems
    To shepherds from the sky.

[Refrain] Repeat the hymn again:
          "To God on high be glory
          And peace on earth to men!"

[3] While thus they sing your Monarch,
    Those bright angelic bands,
    Rejoice, ye vales and mountains,
    Ye oceans, clap your hands.

[Refrain] Repeat the hymn again:
          "To God on high be glory
          And peace on earth to men!"

[4] Since all He comes to ransom,
    By all be He adored,
    The Infant born in Bethl'em,
    The Savior and the Lord.

[Refrain] Repeat the hymn again:
          "To God on high be glory
          And peace on earth to men!"

[5] And idol forms shall perish,
    And error shall decay,
    And Christ shall wield His scepter,
    Our Lord and God for aye.

[Refrain] Repeat the hymn again:
          "To God on high be glory
          And peace on earth to men!"
          Amen
