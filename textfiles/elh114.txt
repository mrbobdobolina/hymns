Tune: REGENT SQUARE
File: elh114.txt

[1] Angels from the realms of glory,
    Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
    Ye who sang creation's story
    Now proclaim Messiah's birth:

[Refrain] Come and worship, Come and worship,
          Worship Christ, the newborn King.

[2] Shepherds in the fields abiding,
    Watching o'er your flocks by night,
    God with man is now residing,
    Yonder shines the Infant Light.

[Refrain] Come and worship, Come and worship,
          Worship Christ, the newborn King.

[3] Sages, leave your contemplations,
    Brighter visions beam afar;
    Seek the great Desire of nations,
    Ye have seen His natal star.

[Refrain] Come and worship, Come and worship,
          Worship Christ, the newborn King.

[4] Saints before the altar bending,
    Watching long in hope and fear,
    Suddenly the Lord, descending,
    In His Temple shall appear.

[Refrain] Come and worship, Come and worship,
          Worship Christ, the newborn King.
          Amen
