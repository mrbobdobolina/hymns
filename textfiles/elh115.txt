Hymn #115 - All My Heart Sings and Rejoices
Tune: FROHLICH SOLL MEIN HERZE SPRINGEN
File: elh115.txt

[1] All my heart sings and rejoices
    As I hear Far and near
    Sweetest angel voices.
    "Christ is born," their choirs and singing
    Till the air Ev'rywhere
    Now with joy is ringing.

[2] Forth today the Conqu'ror goeth,
    Who the foe, Sin and woe,
    Death and hell, o'erthroweth.
    God is Man, man to deliver;
    His dear Son Now is one
    With our blood forever.

[3] Shall we still dread God's displeasure,
    Who, to save, Freely gave
    His most cherished Treasure?
    To redeem us, He hath given
    His own Son From the throne
    Of His might in heaven.

[4] Should He who Himself imparted
    Aught withhold From the fold.
    Leave us brokenhearted?
    Should the Son of God not love us,
    Who, to cheer Suff'rers here,
    Left His throne above us?

[5] If our blessed Lord and Maker
    Hated men, Would He then
    Be of flesh partaker?
    If He in our woe delighted,
    Would He bear All the care
    Of our race benighted?

[6] He becomes the Lamb that taketh
    Sin away And for aye
    Full atonement maketh.
    For our life His own He tenders
    And our race, By His grace,
    Meet for glory renders.

[7] Hark! a voice from yonder manger,
    Soft and sweet, Doth entreat:
    "Flee from woe and danger.
    Brethren, from all ills that grieve you
    You are freed; All you need
    I will surely give you."

[8] Come, then, banish all your sadness,
    One and all, Great and small;
    Come with songs of gladness.
    Love Him who with love is glowing;
    Hail the Star Near and far
    Light and joy bestowing.

[9] Ye whose anguish knew no measure,
    Weep no more; See the door
    To celestial pleasure.
    Cling to Him, for He will guide you
    Where no cross, Pain, or loss
    Can again betide you.

[10] Hither come, ye heavy-hearted,
     Who for sin, Deep within,
     Long and sore have smarted;
     For the poisoned wounds you're feeling
     Help is near, One is here
     Mighty for their healing.

[11] Hither come, ye poor and wretched;
     Know His will Is to fill
     Every hand outstretched.
     Here are riches without measure;
     Here forget All regret
     Fill your hearts with treasure.

[12] Let me in my arms receive Thee;
     On Thy breast Let me rest,
     Savior, ne'er to leave Thee.
     Since Thou hast Thyself presented
     Now to me, I shall be
     Evermore contented.

[13] Guilt no longer can distress me;
     Son of God, Thou my load
     Bearest to release me.
     Stain in me Thou findest never;
     I am clean, All my sin
     Is removed forever.

[14] I am pure, in Thee believing,
     From Thy store Evermore
     Righteous robes receiving.
     In my heart I will enfold Thee,
     Treasure rare, Let me there,
     Loving, ever hold Thee.

[15] Dearest Lord, Thee will I cherish,
     Though my breath Fail in death,
     Yet I shall not perish,
     But with Thee abide forever
     There on high, In that joy
     Which can vanish never.
     Amen
