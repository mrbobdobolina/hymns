Hymn #116 - Angels We Have Heard on High
Tune: GLORIA
File: elh116.txt

[1] Angels we have heard on high,
    Sweetly singing o'er the plains,
    And the mountains in reply,
    Echoing their joyous strains.

[Refrain] Gloria in excelsis Deo;
          Gloria in excelsis Deo.

[2] Shepherds, why this jubilee?
    Why your joyous strains prolong?
    What the gladsome tidings be
    Which inspire your heav'nly song?

[Refrain] Gloria in excelsis Deo;
          Gloria in excelsis Deo.

[3] Come to Bethlehem and see
    Him whose birth the angels sing;
    Come, adore on bended knee
    Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

[Refrain] Gloria in excelsis Deo;
          Gloria in excelsis Deo.

[4] See, within a manger laid,
    Jesus, Lord of heav'n and earth,
    Lend your voices, lend your aid
    To proclaim the Savior's birth!

[Refrain] Gloria in excelsis Deo;
          Gloria in excelsis Deo.
          Amen
