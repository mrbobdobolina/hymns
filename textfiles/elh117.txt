Hymn #117 - As Each Happy Christmas
Tune: ALLE JAHRE WIEDER
File: elh117.txt

[1] As each happy Christmas
    Dawns on earth again,
    Comes the holy Christ Child
    To the hearts of men.

[2] Enters with His blessing
    Into ev'ry home,
    Guides and guards our footsteps
    As we go and come.

[3] All unknown, beside me
    He will ever stand,
    And will safely lead me
    With His own right hand.
    Amen
