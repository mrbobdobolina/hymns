Hymn #119 - Away in a Manger
Tune: CRADLE SONG
File: elh119.txt

[1] Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
    The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.
    The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay,
    The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

[2] The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
    But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes.
    I love Thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
    And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

[3] Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask Thee to stay
    Close by me forever and love me, I pray.
    Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
    And take us to heaven to live with Thee there.
    Amen
