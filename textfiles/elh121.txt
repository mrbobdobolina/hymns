Hymn #121 - Behold, a Branch Is Growing
Tune: ES IST EIN ROS
File: elh121.txt

[1] Behold, a Branch is growing
    Of loveliest form and grace,
    As prophets sung, foreknowing;
    It springs from Jesse's race
    And bears one little Flow'r
    In midst of coldest winter,
    At deepest midnight hour.

[2] Isaiah had foretold It
    In words of promise sure,
    And Mary's arms enfold It,
    A Virgin meek and pure.
    Through God's eternal will
    This Child to her is given
    At midnight calm and still.

[3] The shepherds heard the story,
    Proclaimed by angels bright,
    How Christ, the Lord of Glory,
    Was born on earth this night.
    To Bethlehem they sped
    And in the manger found Him,
    As angel heralds said.

[4] This Flow'r, whose fragrance tender,
    With sweetness fills the air,
    Dispels with glorious splendor
    That darkness ev'rywhere.
    True Man, yet very God;
    From sin and death He saves us
    And lightens ev'ry load.

[5] O Savior, Child of Mary,
    Who felt our human woe;
    O Savior, King of Glory,
    Who dost our weakness know,
    Bring us at length, we pray,
    To the bright courts of heaven
    And to the endless day.
    Amen
