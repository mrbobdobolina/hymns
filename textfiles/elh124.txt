Hymn #124 - From Heaven Above to Earth I Come
Tune: VOM HIMMEL HOCH
File: elh124.txt

[1] "From heav'n above to earth I come
    To bear good news to ev'ry home;
    Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
    Whereof I now will say and sing:

[2] "To you this night is born a Child
    Of Mary, chosen Virgin mild;
    This little Child, of lowly birth,
    Shall be the joy of all the earth.

[3] 'Tis Christ, our God, who far on high
    Hath heard your sad and bitter cry;
    Himself will your salvation be,
    Himself from sin will make you free.

[4] "He brings those blessings, long ago
    Prepared by God for all below,
    Henceforth His kingdom open stands
    To you, as to the angel bands.

[5] "These are the token ye shall mark:
    The swaddling-clothes and manger dark.
    There ye shall find the Infant laid
    By whom the heav'ns and earth were made."

[6] Now let us all with gladsome cheer
    Follow the shepherds and draw near
    To see the precious gift of God,
    Who hath His only Son bestowed.

[7] Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes!
    Who is it in yon manger lies?
    Who is this Child, so young and fair?
    The blessed Christ-child lieth there.

[8] Welcome to earth, Thou noble Guest,
    Through whom the sinful world is blest!
    Thou com'st to share my misery;
    What can we render, Lord, to Thee!

[9] Ah, Lord, who hast created all,
    How weak art Thou, how poor and small,
    That Thou dost choose Thine infant bed
    Where ass and ox but lately fed!

[10] Were earth a thousand times as fair,
     Beset with gold and jewels rare,
     It yet were far too poor to be
     A narrow cradle, Lord, for Thee.

[11] For velvets soft and silken stuff
     Thou hast but hay and straw so rough,
     Whereon Thou, King, so rich and great,
     As 'twere Thy heav'n, art throned in state.

[12] Thus hath it pleased Thee to make plain
     The truth to sinners poor and vain,
     That this world's honor, wealth and might
     Are naught and worthless in Thy sight.

[13] Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child,
     Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled,
     Within my heart, that it may be
     A quiet chamber kept for Thee.

[14] My heart for very joy doth leap;
     My lips no more can silence keep.
     I, too, must sing with joyful tongue
     That sweetest ancient cradle-song:

[15] Glory to God in highest heav'n,
     Who unto us His Son hath giv'n!
     While angels sing with pious mirth
     A glad new year to all the earth.
     Amen
