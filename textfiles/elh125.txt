Tune: MENDELSSOHN
File: elh125.txt

[1] Hark! The herald angels sing,
    "Glory to the newborn King!
    Peace on earth and mercy mild,
    God and sinners reconciled!"
    Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
    Join the triumph of the skies;
    With th' angelic host proclaim,
    "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"

[Refrain] Hark! The herald angels sing,
          "Glory to the newborn King!"

[2] Christ, by highest heav'n adored,
    Christ, the everlasting Lord,
    Late in time behold Him come,
    Offspring of a Virgin's womb.
    Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,
    Hail, th' incarnate Deity!
    Pleased as Man with man to dwell;
    Jesus, our Immanuel!

[Refrain] Hark! The herald angels sing,
          "Glory to the newborn King!"

[3] Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!
    Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
    Light and life to all He brings,
    Ris'n with healing in His wings.
    Mild He leaves His throne on high,
    Born that man no more may die;
    Born to raise the sons of earth;
    Born to give us second birth,

[Refrain] Hark! The herald angels sing,
          "Glory to the newborn King!"

[4] Come, Desire of Nations, come,
    Fix in us Thy humble home;
    Rise, the woman's conqu'ring Seed,
    Bruise in us the serpent's head.
    Adam's likeness, Lord, efface;
    Print Thine image in its place;
    O to all Thyself impart,
    Formed in each believing heart.

[Refrain] Hark! The herald angels sing,
          "Glory to the newborn King!"
          Amen
