Hymn #126 - God Rest You Merry
Tune: GOD REST YOU MERRY
File: elh126.txt

[1] God rest you merry, gentlemen,
    Let nothing you dismay,
    For Jesus Christ, our Savior,
    Was born on Christmas Day
    To save us all from Satan's pow'r
    When we were gone astray.

[Refrain] O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
          O tidings of comfort and joy.

[2] From God, our heav'nly Father,
    A blessed angel came;
    And unto certain shepherds
    Brought tidings of the same:
    How that in Bethlehem was born
    The Son of God by name.

[Refrain] O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
          O tidings of comfort and joy.

[3] "Fear not" then said the angel,
    "Let nothing you affright;
    This day is born the Savior,
    A Babe of glorious might.
    See, death and hell and Satan
    This child shall put to flight."

[Refrain] O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
          O tidings of comfort and joy.

[4] Now to the Lord sing praises,
    All you within this place,
    In Christian faith and charity
    Each other now embrace,
    This holy tide of Christmas
    Reveals to us God's grace.

[Refrain] O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
          O tidings of comfort and joy.
          Amen
