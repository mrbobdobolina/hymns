Hymn #128 - Come, Your Hearts and Voices Raising
Tune: QUEM PASTORES
File: elh128.txt

[1] Come, your hearts and voices raising,
    Christ the Lord with gladness praising;
    Loudly sing His love amazing,
    Worthy folk of Christendom.

[2] Sin and death may well be groaning,
    Satan now may well be moaning;
    We, our full salvation owning,
    Cast our ev'ry care away.

[3] See how God, for us providing,
    Gave His Son and life abiding;
    He our weary steps is guiding
    From earth's woe to heav'nly joy.

[4] Christ, from heav'n to us descending
    And in love our race befriending,
    In our need His help extending,
    Saved us from the wily foe.

[5] Jacob's Star in all its splendor
    Beams with comfort sweet and tender,
    Forcing Satan to surrender,
    Breaking all the pow'rs of hell.

[6] From the bondage that oppressed us,
    From sin's fetters that oppressed us,
    From the grief that sore distressed us,
    We, the captives, now are free.

[7] O the joy beyond expressing
    When by faith we grasp this blessing,
    And to Thee we come confessing
    That our freedom Thou hast wrought!

[8] Gracious Child, we pray Thee, hear us,
    From Thy lowly manger cheer us,
    Gently lead us and be near us
    Till we join th' angelic choir.
    Amen
