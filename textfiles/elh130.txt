Hymn #130 - I Sing the Birth
Tune: KOMMT HER ZU MIR
File: elh130.txt

[1] I sing the birth was born tonight,
    The Author both of life and light:
    The angels so did sound it;
    And like the ravished shepherds said,
    Who saw the light and were afraid,
    Yet searched, and true they found it.

[2] The Son of God, th' eternal King,
    That did us all salvation bring,
    And freed the world from danger,
    He whom the whole world could not take,
    The Lord which heav'n and earth did make,
    Was now laid in a manger.

[3] The Father's wisdom willed it so,
    The Son's obedience knew no No,
    Both wills were in one stature;
    And, as that wisdom hath decreed,
    The Word was now made flesh indeed,
    And took on Him our nature.

[4] What comfort by Him do we win,
    Who made Himself the price of sin,
    To make us heirs of glory!
    To see this Babe, all innocence,
    A martyr born in our defense--
    Can man forget this story?
    Amen
