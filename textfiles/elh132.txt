Tune: JEG VIL MIG HERREN LOVE
File: elh132.txt

[1] Rejoice, rejoice, ye Christians,
    With all your hearts, this morn!
    O hear the blessed tidings,
    "The Lord, the Christ, is born,"
    Now brought us by the angels
    That stand about God's throne;
    O lovely are the voices
    That make such tidings known!

[2] O hearken to their singing!
    This Child shall be your Friend;
    The Father so hath willed it
    That thus your woes should end.
    The Son is freely given,
    That in Him ye may have
    The Father's grace and blessing,
    And know He loves to save.

[3] Nor deem the form too lowly
    That clothes Him at this hour;
    For know ye what it hideth?
    'Tis God's almighty pow'r.
    Though now within the manger
    So poor and weak He lies;
    He is the Lord of all things,
    He reigns above the skies.

[4] Sin, death, and hell, and Satan
    Have lost the victory;
    This Child shall overthrow them,
    As ye shall surely see.
    Their wrath shall naught avail them;
    Fear not, their reign is o'er;
    This Child shall overthrow them--
    O hear, and doubt no more.
    Amen
