File: elh133.txt

[1] O come, all ye faithful,
    joyful and triumphant,
    O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
    Come and behold Him,
    born the King of angels:

[Refrain] O come, let us adore Him,
          O come, let us adore Him,
          O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

[2] God of God,
    Light of Light,
    Lo! He comes forth from the Virgin's womb.
    Our very God,
    begotten not created,

[Refrain] O come, let us adore Him,
          O come, let us adore Him,
          O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

[3] Sing, choirs of angels,
    sing in exultation,
    Sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above!
    Glory to God,
    all glory in the highest;

[Refrain] O come, let us adore Him,
          O come, let us adore Him,
          O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

[4] Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
    born this happy morning;
    Jesus, to Thee be all glory giv'n;
    Word of the Father,
    now in flesh appearing;

[Refrain] O come, let us adore Him,
          O come, let us adore Him,
          O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!
          Amen
