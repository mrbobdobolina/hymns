Hymn #134 - Let Us All with Gladsome Voice
Tune: LASST UNS ALLE, FROHLICH SEIN
File: elh134.txt

[1] Let us all with gladsome voice
    Praise the God of heaven,
    Who, to bid our hearts rejoice,
    His own Son has given.

[2] To this veil of fears He comes,
    Here to serve in sadness,
    That with Him in heav'n's fair homes
    We may reign in gladness.

[3] We are rich, for He was poor;
    Is not this a wonder?
    Therefore praise God evermore
    Here on earth and yonder.

[4] O Lord Christ, our Savior dear,
    Be Thou ever near us.
    Grant us now a glad new year.
    Amen, Jesus, hear us!
    Amen
