Hymn #135 - Now Sing We, Now Rejoice
Tune: IN DULCI JUBILO
File: elh135.txt

[1] Now sing we, now rejoice,
    Now raise to heav'n our voice;
    Lo! He from whom joy streameth,
    Poor in a manger lies;
    Yet not so brightly beameth
    The sun in yonder skies!
    Thou my Savior art!
    Thou my Savior art!

[2] Giv'n from on high to me;
    I cannot rise to Thee.
    O cheer my wearied spirit:
    O pure and holy Child,
    Through all Thy grace and merit,
    Blest Jesus, Lord most mild,
    Draw me unto Thee!
    Draw me unto Thee!

[3] Now through His Son doth shine
    The Father's grace divine.
    Death over us had reigned
    Through sin and vanity;
    The Son for us obtained
    Eternal joy on high.
    May we praise Him there!
    May we praise Him there!

[4] O where shall joy be found?
    Where but on heav'nly ground?
    Where now the angels singing
    With all His saints unite,
    Their sweetest praises bringing
    In heav'nly joy and light.
    May we praise Him there!
    May we praise Him there!
    Amen
