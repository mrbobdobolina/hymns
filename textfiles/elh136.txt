Tune: GELOBET SEIST DU, JESU CHRIST
File: elh136.txt

[1] O Jesus Christ, all praise to Thee,
    Thou who art pleased a Man to be;
    To dwell with men Thou dost not scorn,
    And angels shout to see Thee born,
    Alleluia.

[2] Th' eternal Father's only Son
    Now takes a manger for His throne:
    The everlasting fount of good,
    Assumes our mortal flesh and blood.
    Alleluia.

[3] He whom the world cannot enclose
    In Mary's bosom doth repose;
    To be a little, Child He deigns
    Who all things by Himself sustains.
    Alleluia.

[4] Th' eternal Light to us descends,
    Its brightness to the earth it lends,
    And purely shines upon our night,
    To make us children of the light.
    Alleluia.

[5] The only Son, true god confessed,
    To His own world now comes a Guest;
    And through this vale of tears our Guide,
    Doth in His heav'n our home provide.
    Alleluia.

[6] In poorest guise to us He came,
    Himself He bears our sin and shame,
    That, as His heirs in heav'n above,
    We may with angels share His love.
    Alleluia.

[7] His love to show, surpassing thought!
    God's Son this wondrous work hath wrought;
    Then let us all unite to raise
    Our song of glad, unceasing praise.
    Alleluia.
    Amen
