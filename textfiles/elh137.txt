Hymn #137 - O Little Town of Bethlehem
Tune: ST. LOUIS
File: elh137.txt

[1] O little town of Bethlehem,
    How still we see thee lie;
    Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
    The silent stars go by;
    Yet in thy dark streets shineth
    The everlasting Light.
    The hopes and fears of all the years
    Are met in thee tonight.

[2] For Christ is born of Mary,
    And, gathered all above,
    While mortals sleep, the angels keep
    Their watch of wond'ring love.
    O morning stars, together
    Proclaim the holy birth!
    And praises sing to God the King,
    And peace to all on earth.

[3] How silently, how silently
    The wondrous gift is giv'n!
    So God imparts to human hearts
    The blessing of His heav'n.
    No ear may hear His coming;
    But in this world of sin,
    Where meek souls will receive Him, still
    The dear Christ enters in.

[4] O holy Child of Bethlehem,
    Descend to us, we pray;
    Cast out our sin, and enter in,
    Be born in us today.
    We hear the Christmas angels
    The great glad tidings tell;
    O come to us, abide with us,
    Our Lord Immanuel!
    Amen
