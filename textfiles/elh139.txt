Hymn #139 - Once in Royal David's City
Tune: IRBY
File: elh139.txt

[1] Once in royal David's city
    Stood a lowly cattle shed
    Where a mother laid her Baby
    In a manger for His bed.
    Mary was that mother mild,
    Jesus Christ her little Child.

[2] He came down to earth from heaven,
    Who is God and Lord of all,
    And His shelter was a stable,
    And His cradle was a stall;
    With the poor and mean and lowly
    Lived on earth our Savior holy.

[3] Jesus is our childhood's pattern;
    Day by day like us He grew;
    He was little, weak, and helpless;
    Tears and smiles like us He knew;
    And He feeleth for our sadness,
    And He shareth in our gladness.

[4] And our eyes at last shall see Him,
    Through His own redeeming love;
    For that Child so dear and helpless;
    Is our Lord in heav'n above;
    And He leads His children on
    To the place where He is gone.

[5] Not in that poor lowly stable
    With the oxen standing by
    We shall see Him, but in heaven,
    Set at God's right hand on high;
    Where, like stars, His children, crowned,
    All in white shall wait around.
    Amen
