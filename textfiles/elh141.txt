Hymn #141 - Once He Came in Blessing
Tune: GOTTES SOHN IST KOMMEN
File: elh141.txt

[1] Once He came in blessing,
    All our ills redressing;
    Came in likeness lowly,
    Son of God most holy;
    Bore the cross to save us,
    Hope and freedom gave us.

[2] Still He comes within us;
    Still His voice would win us
    From the sins that hurt us;
    Would to truth convert us
    From our foolish error
    Ere He comes in terror.

[3] Who by faith endureth
    Bright reward secureth.
    Come, then, O Lord Jesus,
    From our sins release us;
    Let us here confess Thee
    Till in heav'n we bless Thee.
    Amen
