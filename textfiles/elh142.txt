File: elh142.txt

[1] Rejoice, rejoice this happy morn!
    A Savior unto us is born,
    The Christ, the Lord of glory.
    His lowly birth in Bethlehem
    The angels from on high proclaim
    And sing redemption's story.
    My soul, Extol God's great favor,
    Bless Him ever For salvation,
    Give Him praise and adoration!
    Amen
