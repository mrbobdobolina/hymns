Hymn #143 - The Happy Christmas Comes Once More
Tune: DET KIMER NU TIL JULEFEST
File: elh143.txt

[1] The happy Christmas comes once more;
    The heav'nly Guest is at the door,
    The blessed words the shepherds thrill,
    The joyous tidings: Peace, goodwill.

[2] To David's city let us fly,
    Where angels sing beneath the sky;
    Through plain and village pressing near,
    And news from God with shepherds hear.

[3] O let us go with quiet mind,
    The gentle Babe with shepherds find,
    To gaze on Him who gladdens them,
    The loveliest flow'r on Jesse's stem.

[4] The lowly Savior meekly lies,
    Laid off the splendor of the skies;
    No crown bedecks His forehead fair,
    No pearl, nor gem, nor silk is there.

[5] No human glory, might, and gold,
    The lovely Infant's form enfold;
    The manger and the swaddlings poor
    Are His, whom angels' songs adore.

[6] O wake our hearts, in gladness sing,
    And keep our Christmas with our King,
    Till living song, from loving souls,
    Like sound of mighty water rolls!

[7] O holy Child, Thy manger gleams
    Till earth and heav'n glow with its beams,
    Till midnight hath noon's brightness won,
    And Jacob's Star outshines the sun.

[8] Thou patriarch's joy, Thou prophet's song,
    Thou heav'nly Day-spring looked for long,
    Thou Son of Man, incarnate Word,
    Great David's Son, great David's Lord!

[9] Come, Jesus, glorious heav'nly Guest,
    Keep Thine own Christmas in our breast;
    Then David's harp-string, hushed so long,
    Shall swell our jubilee of song.
    Amen
