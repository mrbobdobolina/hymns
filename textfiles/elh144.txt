Tune: HER KOMMER DINE, ARME SMAA
File: elh144.txt

[1] Thy little ones dear Lord, are we,
    And come Thy lowly bed to see;
    Enlighten ev'ry soul and mind,
    That we the way to Thee may find.

[2] With songs we hasten Thee to greet
    And kiss the dust before Thy feet;
    O blessed hour, O sweetest night,
    That gave Thee birth, our soul's delight.

[3] Now welcome! From Thy heav'nly home
    Thou to our vale of tears art come;
    Man hath no off'ring for Thee save
    The stable, manger, cross, and grave.

[4] Jesus, alas! how can it be
    So few bestow a thought on Thee
    Or on the love, so wondrous great,
    That drew Thee down to our estate?

[5] O draw us wholly to Thee, Lord,
    Do Thou to us Thy grace accord,
    True faith and love to us impart,
    That we may hold Thee in our heart.

[6] Keep us, howe'er the world may lure,
    In our baptismal cov'nant pure;
    That ev'ry yearning thought may be
    Directed only unto Thee

[7] Until at last we, too, proclaim,
    With all Thy saints, Thy glorious name;
    In Paradise our songs renew,
    And praise Thee as the angels do.

[8] We gather round Thee, Jesus dear,
    So happy in Thy presence here;
    Grant us, our Savior, ev'ry one,
    To stand in heav'n before Thy throne.
    Amen
