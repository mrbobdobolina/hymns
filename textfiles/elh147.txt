Hymn #147 - While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks
Tune: WINCHESTER OLD
File: elh147.txt

[1] While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
    All seated on the ground,
    The angel of the Lord came down,
    And glory shone around.

[2] "Fear not," said he, for mighty dread
    Had seized their troubled mind;
    "Glad tidings of great joy I bring
    To you and all mankind.

[3] "To you, in David's town, this day,
    Is born of David's line
    A Savior, who is Christ the Lord;
    And this shall be the sign:

[4] The heav'nly Babe you there shall find
    To human view displayed,
    All meanly wrapped in swaddling-clothes
    And in a manger laid."

[5] Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
    Appeared a shining throng
    Of angels, praising God, and thus
    Addressed their joyful song:

[6] "All glory be to God on high,
    And to the earth be peace;
    God will henceforth from Heav'n to men
    Begin and never cease."
    Amen
