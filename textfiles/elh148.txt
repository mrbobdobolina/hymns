Tune: LOBT GOTT, IHR CHRISTEN
File: elh148.txt

[1] Praise God the Lord, ye sons of men,
    Before His highest throne;
    Today He open's heav'n again
    And gives us His own Son,
    And gives us His own Son.

[2] He leaves His heav'nly Father's throne,
    Is born an Infant small,
    And in a manger, poor and lone,
    Lies in a humble stall,
    Lies in a humble stall.

[3] He veils in flesh His pow'r divine
    A servant's form to take;
    In want and lowliness must pine
    Who heav'n and earth did make,
    Who heav'n and earth did make.

[4] He nestles at His mother's breast,
    Receives her tender care,
    Whom angels hail with joy most blest,
    King David's royal Heir,
    King David's royal Heir.

[5] 'Tis He who in these latter days
    From Judah's tribe should come,
    By whom the Father would upraise
    The Church, His Christendom,
    The Church, His Christendom.

[6] A wondrous change which He does make!
    He takes our flesh and blood,
    And He conceals for sinners' sake
    His majesty of God,
    His majesty of God.

[7] He serves that I a lord may be;
    A great exchange indeed!
    Could Jesus' love do more for me
    To help me in my need,
    To help me in my need?

[8] For us He opens wide the door
    Of paradise today;
    The angel guards the gate no more.
    To God our thanks we pay,
    To God our thanks we pay.
    Amen
