Hymn #149 - In Thee Is Gladness
Tune: IN DIR IST FREUDE
File: elh149.txt

[1] In Thee is gladness
    Amid all sadness,
    Jesus, sunshine of my heart.
    By Thee are given
    The gifts of heaven;
    Thou the true Redeemer art.
    Our souls Thou wakest;
    Our bonds Thou breakest.
    Who trusts Thee surely
    Has built securely
    And stands forever:
    Alleluia!
    Our hearts are pining
    To see Thy shining,
    Dying or living,
    To Thee are cleaving;
    Naught us can sever:
    Alleluia!

[2] Since He is ours,
    We fear no powers,
    Not of earth nor sin nor death.
    He sees and blesses
    In worst distresses;
    He can change them with a breath.
    Wherefore the story
    Tell of His glory
    With hearts and voices;
    All heav'n rejoices
    In Him forever:
    Alleluia!
    We shout for gladness,
    Triumph o'er sadness,
    Love Him and praise Him
    And still shall raise Him
    Glad hymns forever:
    Alleluia!
    Amen
