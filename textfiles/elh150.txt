Tune: DER TAG, DER IST SO FREUDENREICH
File: elh150.txt

[1] In this our happy Christmastide
    The joyful bells are ringing;
    To praise be all our pow'rs applied,
    God's grace and mercy singing;
    In Him by whom the world was made,
    Now in the lowly manger laid,
    Rejoice we in the spirit;
    Thy praise, O Savior, we will sound
    Unto the earth's remotest bound,
    That all the world shall hear it.

[2] A little Son, the Virgin-born,
    True God from everlasting
    To rescue us who were forlorn,
    His lot with us is casting:
    It moved His tender heart to see
    This world of sin and misery
    In condemnation lying;
    Therefore He came from realms above
    Down to our earth, drawn by His love,
    To soothe our grief and sighing.

[3] Our thanks we offer Him today,
    Although a poor oblation,
    Alleluia! our joyful lay,
    Shall sound through ev'ry nation;
    Now in our camp the Ark we see,
    Therefore we shout the victory
    With joyful hearts unfearing;
    We sing of peace, the peace profound,
    That hell shall tremble at the sound,
    Our Christmas anthem hearing.

[4] That God has laid His anger by,
    He by His gift hath shown us;
    He gives His Son for us to die,
    In Him He now doth own us;
    These joyful tidings tell abroad,
    That Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
    From sin doth us deliver;
    Who then should not be glad today
    When Christ is born, the sinners' stay,
    Who is of grace the giver?

[5] As darkest night must fade and die
    Before the sun's appearing,
    So fades my grief away, when I
    Think on these tidings cheering,
    That God from all eternity
    Hath loved the world, and hath on me
    Bestowed His grace and favor;
    I'll ne'er forget the angels' strain:
    Peace--peace on earth, good will to men,
    To you is born a Savior!

[6] Although my joyful Christmas lay
    Is mingled with my sighing,
    The cross shall never take away
    My joy and praise undying;
    For when the heart is most opprest,
    The harp of joy is tuned the best,
    The better strains are ringing,
    The cross itself, at Jesus' will,
    Must aid my soul, that I may still
    In grief His praise be singing.

[7] Alleluia! our strife is o'er,
    Who, then, should pine in sadness?
    Who now should grieve in anguish sore
    In these our days of gladness?
    Thou Church of God, O sing this morn:
    To us is Christ the Savior born,
    O joy that none can sever!
    Alleluia! sing thou my heart,
    Now Christ is mine, I can depart
    To be with Him forever.
    Amen
