Tune: VALET WILL ICH DIR GEBEN
File: elh151.txt

[1] Thou Light of Gentile nations,
    Thou Savior from above,
    Drawn by Thy Spirit's leading,
    We come with joy and love
    Into Thy holy temple
    And wait with earnest mind
    As Simeon once had waited
    His God and Lord to find.

[2] Yea, Lord, Thy servants meet Thee
    In ev'ry holy place
    Where Thy true Word has promised
    That we should see Thy face.
    Today Thou still dost grant us
    Who gather round Thee here
    In arms of faith to bear Thee
    As did that aged seer.

[3] Be Thou our Joy and Brightness,
    Our Cheer in pain and loss,
    Our Sun in darkest terror,
    The Glory round our cross,
    A Star for sinking spirits,
    A Beacon in distress,
    Physician, Friend, in sickness,
    In death our Happiness.

[4] Let us, O Lord, be faithful
    Like Simeon to the end,
    So that his prayer exultant
    May from our hearts ascend:
    "O Lord, now let Thy servant
    Depart in peace, I pray,
    Since I have seen my Savior
    And here beheld His day."

[5] My Savior, I behold Thee
    With faith's enlightened eye;
    Of Thee no foe can rob me,
    His threats I can defy.
    Within Thy heart abiding,
    As Thou, O Lord, in me,
    Death can no longer frighten
    Nor part my soul from Thee.

[6] Lord, here on earth Thou seemest
    At times to frown on me,
    And through my tears I often
    Can scarce distinguish Thee;
    But in the heav'nly mansions
    Shall nothing dim my sight;
    There shall I see Thy glory
    In never-changing light.
    Amen
