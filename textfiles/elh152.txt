[1] We sing, Immanuel, Thy praise,
    Thou Prince of Life and Fount of grace,
    Thou Flow'r of heav'n and Star of morn,
    Thou Lord of lords, Thou Virgin-born.
    Alleluia!

[2] For Thee, since first the world was made,
    So many hearts have watched and prayed;
    The patriarchs' and prophets' throng
    For Thee have hoped and waited long.
    Alleluia!

[3] Now art Thou here, Thou Ever-blest!
    In lowly manger dost Thou rest.
    Thou, making all things great, art small;
    So poor art Thou, yet clothest all.
    Alleluia!

[4] From Thee above all gladness flows,
    Yet Thou must bear such bitter woes;
    The Gentiles' Light and Hope Thou art,
    Yet findest none to soothe Thine heart.
    Alleluia!

[5] But I, Thy servant, Lord, today
    Confess my love and freely say,
    I love Thee truly, but I would
    That I might love Thee as I should.
    Alleluia!

[6] I have the will, the pow'r is weak;
    Yet, Lord, my humble off'ring take
    And graciously the love receive
    Which my poor heart to Thee can give.
    Alleluia!

[7] Had I no load of sin to bear,
    Thy grace, O Lord, I could not share;
    In vain hadst Thou been born for me
    If from God's wrath I had been free.
    Alleluia!

[8] Thus will I sing Thy praises here
    With joyful spirit year by year;
    And when we reckon years no more,
    May I in heav'n Thy name adore!
    Alleluia!
    Amen
