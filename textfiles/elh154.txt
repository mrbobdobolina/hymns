Hymn #154 - To Shepherds as They Watched by Night
Tune: ICH KOMM AUS FREMDEN LANDEN HER
File: elh154.txt

[1] To shepherds as they watched by night
    Appeared a host of angels bright;
    "Behold the tender Babe," they said,
    "In yonder lowly manger laid,

[2] "At Bethlehem, in David's town,
    As Micah did of old make known.
    'Tis Jesus Christ, your Lord and King,
    Who doth to all salvation bring."

[3] O then rejoice that through His Son
    God is with sinners now at one;
    Made like yourselves of flesh and blood,
    Your Brother is th' eternal God.

[4] What harm can sin and death then do?
    The true God now abides with you.
    Let hell and Satan rage and chafe,
    Christ is your Brother--ye are safe.

[5] Not one He will or can forsake
    Who Him his confidence doth make.
    Let all his wiles the Tempter try,
    You may his utmost pow'rs defy.

[6] Ye shall and must at last prevail;
    God's own ye are, ye cannot fail.
    To God forever sing your praise
    With joy and patience all your days.
    Amen
