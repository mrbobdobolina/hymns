Hymn #155 - How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds
Tune: ST. PETER
File: elh155.txt

[1] How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
    In a believer's ear!
    It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
    And drives away his fear.

[2] It makes the wounded spirit whole
    And calms the troubled breast;
    'Tis manna to the hungry soul
    And to the weary, rest.

[3] Dear name! The Rock on which I build,
    My Shield and Hiding Place;
    My never-failing Treasury, filled
    With boundless stores of grace.

[4] By Thee my pray'rs acceptance gain
    Although with sin defiled.
    Satan accuses me in vain,
    And I am owned a child.

[5] Jesus, my Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,
    My Prophet, Priest, and King,
    My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
    Accept the praise I bring.

[6] Weak is the effort of my heart
    And cold my warmest thought;
    But when I see Thee as Thou art,
    I'll praise Thee as I ought.

[7] Till then I would Thy love proclaim
    With ev'ry fleeting breath;
    And may the music of Thy name
    Refresh my soul in death!
    Amen
