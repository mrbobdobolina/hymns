Hymn #156 - Jesus! Name of Wondrous Love
Tune: GOTT SEI DANK
File: elh156.txt

[1] Jesus! Name of wondrous love,
    Name all other names above,
    Unto which must ev'ry knee
    Bow in deep humility.

[2] Jesus! Name decreed of old,
    To the maiden mother told--
    Kneeling in her lowly cell--
    By the angel Gabriel.

[3] Jesus! Name of priceless worth
    To the fallen sons of earth
    For the promise that it gave,
    "Jesus shall His people save."

[4] Jesus! Name of mercy mild,
    Given to the holy Child
    When the cup of human woe
    First He tasted here below.

[5] Jesus! Only name that's giv'n
    Under all the mighty heav'n
    Whereby man, to sin enslaved,
    Bursts his fetters and are saved.

[6] Jesus! Name of wondrous love,
    Human name of God above;
    Pleading only this, we flee,
    Helpless, O our God, to Thee.
    Amen
