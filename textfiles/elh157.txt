Hymn #157 - O Blessed Day When First Was Poured
Tune: ANGELUS
File: elh157.txt

[1] O blessed day when first was poured
    The blood of our redeeming Lord!
    O blessed day when Christ began
    His saving work for sinful man!

[2] While from His mother's bosom fed,
    His precious blood He wills to shed;
    A foretaste of His death He feels,
    An earnest of His love reveals.

[3] Scarce come to earth, His Father's will
    With prompt obedience to fulfill,
    A victim even now He lies
    Before the day of sacrifice.

[4] In love our guilt He undertakes;
    Sinless, for sin atonement makes.
    The great Lawgiver for our aid
    Obedient to the Law is made.

[5] Lord, circumcise our heart, we pray,
    And take what is not Thine away.
    Write Thine own name upon our hearts,
    Thy Law within our inward parts.

[6] O Lord, the Virgin-born, to Thee
    Eternal praise and glory be,
    Whom with the Father we adore
    And Holy Ghost forevermore.
    Amen
