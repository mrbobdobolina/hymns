Hymn #158 - The Ancient Law Departs
Tune: POTSDAM
File: elh158.txt

[1] The ancient Law departs,
    And all its fears remove,
    For Jesus makes with faithful hearts
    A covenant of love.

[2] The Light of Light Divine,
    True brightness undefiled,
    He bears for us the pain of sin,
    A holy, spotless Child.

[3] His infant body now
    Begins the cross to feel;
    Those precious drops of blood that flow
    For death the Victim seal.

[4] Today the name is Thine
    At which we bend the knee.
    They call Thee Jesus, child divine;
    Our Jesus deign to be.

[5] All praise, eternal Son,
    For Thy redeeming love,
    With Father, Spirit, ever One
    In glorious might above.
    Amen
