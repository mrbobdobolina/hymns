Hymn #159 - To the Name of Our Salvation
Tune: SIEH, HIER BIN ICH
File: elh159.txt

[1] To the name of our salvation
    Laud and honor let us pay,
    Which for many a generation
    Hid in God's foreknowledge lay;
    But with holy exultation
    We may sing aloud today.

[2] Jesus is the name we treasure,
    Name beyond what words can tell;
    Name of gladness, name of pleasure,
    Ear and heart delighting well;
    Name of sweetness, passing measure,
    Saving us from sin and hell.

[3] 'Tis the name for adoration;
    'Tis the name of victory;
    'Tis the name for meditation
    In this vale of misery;
    'Tis the name for veneration
    By the citizens on high.

[4] 'Tis the name that whoso preacheth
    Speaks like music to the ear;
    Who in prayer this name beseecheth
    Sweetest comfort findeth near;
    Who its perfect wisdom reacheth
    Heav'nly joy possesseth here.

[5] Jesus is the name prevailing
    Over ev'ry name by right;
    At this name, in terror wailing,
    Pow'rs of hell are put to flight;
    God, in mercy never failing,
    Saves us by this name of might.

[6] Therefore we in love adoring
    This most blessed name revere,
    Holy Jesus, Thee imploring
    So to write it in us here
    That hereafter, heav'nward soaring,
    We may sing with angels there.
    Amen
