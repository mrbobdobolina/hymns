Hymn #160 - O God, Our Help In Ages Past
Tune: ST. ANNE
File: elh160.txt

[1] O God, our Help in ages past,
    Our Hope for years to come,
    Our Shelter from the stormy blast,
    And our eternal Home!

[2] Under the shadow of Thy throne
    Thy saints have dwelt secure;
    Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
    And our defense is sure.

[3] Before the hills in order stood
    Or earth received her frame,
    From everlasting Thou art God,
    To endless years the same.

[4] A thousand ages in Thy sight
    Are like an evening gone,
    Short as the watch that ends the night
    Before the rising sun.

[5] Thy word commands our flesh to dust:
    "Return, ye sons of men!"
    All nations rose from earth at first
    And turn to earth again.

[6] Time, like and ever-rolling stream,
    Bears all its sons away;
    They fly, forgotten, as a dream
    Dies at the opening day.

[7] Like flow'ry fields the nations stand,
    Pleased with the morning light;
    The flow'rs beneath the mower's hand
    Lie with'ring ere 'tis night.

[8] Our God, our Help in ages past,
    Our Hope for years to come,
    Be Thou our Guard while troubles last
    And our eternal Home!
    Amen
