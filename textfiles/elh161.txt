Tune: O JESU CHRIST, DEIN KRIPPLEIN IST
File: elh161.txt

[1] O Jesus Christ, Thy manger is
    My paradise at which my soul reclineth.
    For there, O Lord, Doth lie the Word
    Made flesh for us--herein Thy grace forth shineth.

[2] He whom the sea And wind obey
    Doth come to serve the sinner in great meekness.
    Thou, God's own Son, With us art one,
    Doth join us and our children in our weakness.

[3] Thy light and grace Our guilt efface,
    Thy heav'nly riches all our loss retrieving.
    Immanuel, Thy birth doth quell
    The pow'r of hell and Satan's bold deceiving.

[4] Thou Christian heart, Whoe'er thou art,
    Be of good cheer and let no sorrow move thee.
    For God's own Child, In mercy mild,
    Joins thee to Him--how greatly God must love thee!

[5] Remember thou What glory now
    The Lord prepared thee for all earthly sadness.
    The angel host Can never boast
    Of greater glory, greater bliss or gladness.

[6] The world may hold Her wealth and gold;
    But thou, my heart, keep Christ as thy true treasure.
    To Him hold fast Until at last
    A crown be thine and honor in full measure.
    Amen
