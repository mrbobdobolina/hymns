Hymn #162 - This Little Babe So Few Days Old
Tune: HEUT TRIUMPHIERET GOTTES SOHN
File: elh162.txt

[1] This little Babe so few days old
    Is come to rifle Satan's fold;
    All hell doth at His presence quake,
    Though He Himself for cold doth shake;
    For in this weak unarmed wise
    The gates of hell He will surprise.

[2] With tears He fights and wins the field,
    His tiny breast stands for a shield;
    His battering shot are babish cries,
    His arrows looks of weeping eyes,
    His martial ensigns cold and need,
    And feeble flesh His warrior's steed.

[3] His camp is builded in a stall,
    His bulwark but a broken wall,
    The crib His trench, haystalks His stakes,
    Of shepherds He His army makes;
    And thus, as sure His foe to wound,
    The angels' trumps the charge now sound.

[4] My soul with Christ join thou in fight;
    Stick to His tents, the place of might.
    Within His crib is surest ward;
    This little Babe will be thy guard.
    If thou wilt foil thy foes with joy,
    Then flit not from this heav'nly Boy!
    Amen
