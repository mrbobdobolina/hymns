File: elh163.txt

[1] O rejoice, ye Christians, loudly,
    For our joy hath now begun;
    Wondrous things our God hath done.
    Tell abroad His goodness proudly,
    Who our race hath honored thus,
    That He deigns to dwell with us.

[Refrain] Joy, O joy, beyond all gladness,
          Christ hath done away with sadness!
          Hence, all sorrow and repining,
          For the Sun of Grace is shining!

[2] See, my soul, thy Savior chooses
    Weakness here and poverty;
    In such love He comes to thee.
    Nor the manger bed refuses,
    All He suffers for thy good
    To redeem thee by His blood.

[Refrain] Joy, O joy, beyond all gladness,
          Christ hath done away with sadness!
          Hence, all sorrow and repining,
          For the Sun of Grace is shining!

[3] Lord, how shall I thank Thee rightly?
    I acknowledge that by Thee
    I am saved eternally.
    Let me not forget it lightly,
    But to Thee at all times cleave,
    And my heart true peace receive.

[Refrain] Joy, O joy, beyond all gladness,
          Christ hath done away with sadness!
          Hence, all sorrow and repining,
          For the Sun of Grace is shining!

[4] Jesus, guard and guide Thy members,
    Fill Thy brethren with Thy grace;
    Hear their prayers in ev'ry place.
    Brighten now faith's glowing embers;
    Grant all Christians, far and near,
    Holy peace, and godly cheer!

[Refrain] Joy, O joy, beyond all gladness,
          Christ hath done away with sadness!
          Hence, all sorrow and repining,
          For the Sun of Grace is shining!
          Amen
