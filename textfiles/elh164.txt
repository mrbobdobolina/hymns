Tune: WAS FRAG ICH
File: elh164.txt

[1] Now are the days fulfilled,
    God's Son is manifested
    Now His great majesty
    In human flesh is vested.
    Behold the mighty God,
    By whom all wrath is stilled,
    The woman's promised Seed--
    Now are the days fulfilled.

[2] Now are the days fulfilled,
    Lo, Jacob's Star is shining;
    The gloomy night has fled
    Wherein the world lay pining.
    Now, Israel, look on Him
    Who long thy heart hath thrilled;
    Hear Zion's watchmen cry:
    Now are the days fulfilled.

[3] Now are the days fulfilled,
    The child of God rejoices;
    No bondage of the Law,
    No curses that it voices,
    Can fill our hearts with fear;
    On Christ our hope we build.
    Behold the Prince of Peace--
    Now are the days fulfilled.
    Amen
