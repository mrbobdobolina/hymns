Tune: NUN KOMM, DER HEIDEN HEILAND
File: elh165.txt

[1] Let the earth now praise the Lord,
    Who hath truly kept His word
    And the sinners' Help and Friend
    Now at last to us doth send.

[2] What the fathers most desired,
    What the prophets' heart inspired,
    What they longed for many a year,
    Stands fulfilled in glory here.

[3] Abram's promised great Reward,
    Zion's Helper, Jacob's Lord--
    Him of twofold race behold--
    Truly came, as long foretold.

[4] Welcome, O my Savior, now!
    Hail! My Portion, Lord, art Thou.
    Here, too, in my heart, I pray,
    O prepare Thyself a way!

[5] King of glory, enter in;
    Cleanse it from the filth of sin,
    As Thou hast so often done;
    It belongs to Thee alone.

[6] As Thy coming was in peace,
    Quiet, full of gentleness,
    Let the same mind dwell in me
    That was ever found in Thee.

[7] Comfort, comfort Thou my heart,
    Thou my Strength and Refuge art.
    I am weak, and cunningly
    Satan lays his snares for me.

[8] Bruise for me the serpent's head
    That, set free from doubt and dread,
    I may cleave to Thee in faith,
    Safely kept through life and death,

[9] And when Thou dost come again
    As the glorious King to reign,
    I with joy may see Thy face,
    Freely ransomed by Thy grace.
    Amen
