(hymn words omitted due to copyright restriction)

[1] Arise and shine in splendor,
    Let night to day surrender;
    Thy Light is drawing near.
    Above thee day is beaming,
    In matchless beauty gleaming;
    The glory of the Lord is here.

[2] See earth in darkness lying,
    The heathen nations dying
    In hopeless gloom and night.
    To Thee the Lord of heaven
    Thy Life, thy Hope, hath given
    Great glory, honor, and delight.

[3] The world's remotest races,
    Upon whose weary faces
    The sun looks from the sky,
    Shall run with zeal untiring,
    With joy thy Light desiring
    That breaks upon them from on high.

[4] Lift up thine eyes in wonder;
    See, nations gather yonder,
    They all come unto thee.
    The world has heard Thy story,
    Thy sons come to Thy glory,
    And daughters haste Thy Light to see.

[5] Thy heart will leap for gladness
    When from the realms of sadness
    They come o'er land and sea.
    Thine eyes will wake from slumber
    When people without number
    Come thronging from afar to Thee.

[6] See *** **** ****** coming
    With ****** ***** moving,
    From *****, ***, **** run,
    From *****, **** *** bringing
    And ******* **** **** singing,
    The **** **** ******, **, ev'ryone.
    Amen
