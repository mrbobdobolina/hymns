File: elh167.txt

[1] How lovely shines the Morning Star!
    The nations see and hail afar
    The light in Judah shining,
    Thou David's Son of Jacob's race,
    My Bridegroom and my King of Grace,
    For Thee my heart is pining.
    Lowly, Holy, Great and glorious,
    Thou victorious Prince of graces,
    Filling all the heav'nly places.

[2] O highest joy by mortals won,
    True Son of God and Mary's Son,
    Thou high-born King of ages!
    Thou art my heart's most beauteous Flow'r,
    And Thy blest Gospel's saving pow'r
    My raptured soul engages.
    Thou mine, I Thine; Sing hosanna!
    Heav'nly manna Tasting, eating,
    Whilst Thy love in songs repeating.

[3] Now richly to my waiting heart,
    O Thou, my God, deign to impart
    The grace of love undying.
    In Thy blest body let me be,
    E'en as the branch is in the tree,
    Thy life my life supplying.
    Sighing, Crying, For the savor
    Of Thy favor; Resting never
    Till I rest in Thee forever.

[4] A pledge of peace from God I see
    When Thy pure eyes are turned to me
    To show me Thy good pleasure.
    Jesus, Thy Spirit and Thy Word,
    Thy body and Thy blood, afford
    My soul its dearest treasure.
    Keep me Kindly In Thy favor,
    O my Savior! Thou wilt cheer me;
    Thy Word calls me to draw near Thee.

[5] Thou, mighty Father, in Thy Son
    Didst love me ere Thou hadst begun
    This ancient world's foundation.
    Thy Son hath made a friend of me,
    And when in spirit Him I see,
    I joy in tribulation.
    What bliss Is this! He that liveth
    To me giveth Life forever;
    Nothing me from Him can sever.

[6] Lift up the voice and strike the string,
    Let all glad sounds of music ring
    In God's high praises blended.
    Christ will be with me all the way,
    Today, tomorrow, ev'ry day,
    Till trav'ling days be ended.
    Sing out, Ring out Triumph glorious,
    O victorious, Chosen nation;
    Praise the God of your salvation.

[7] O joy to know that Thou, my Friend,
    Art Lord, Beginning without end,
    The First and Last, Eternal!
    And Thou at length--O glorious grace!--
    Wilt take me to that holy place,
    The home of joys supernal.
    Amen, Amen! Come and meet me!
    Quickly greet me! With deep yearning,
    Lord, I look for Thy returning.
    Amen
