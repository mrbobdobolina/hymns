Hymn #168 - As with Gladness Men of Old
Tune: DIX
File: elh168.txt

[1] As with gladness men of old
    Did the guiding star behold;
    As with joy they hailed its light,
    Leading onward, beaming bright;
    So, most gracious Lord, may we
    Evermore be led by Thee.

[2] As with joyful steps they sped,
    Savior, to Thy lowly bed,
    There to bend the knee before
    Thee, whom heav'n and earth adore;
    So may we with willing feet
    Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

[3] As they offered gifts most rare
    At Thy cradle, rude and bare,
    So may we with holy joy,
    Pure and free from sin's alloy,
    All our costliest treasures bring,
    Christ, to Thee, our heav'nly King.

[4] Holy Jesus, ev'ry day
    Keep us in the narrow way;
    And when earthly things are past,
    Bring our ransomed souls at last
    Where they need no star to guide,
    Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

[5] In the heav'nly country bright
    Need they no created light;
    Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,
    Thou its Sun which goes not down.
    There forever may we sing
    Alleluias to our King!
    Amen
