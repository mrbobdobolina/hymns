Tune: CREATION
File: elh170.txt

[1] O God of God, O Light of Light,
    Thou Prince of Peace, Thou King of kings!
    To Thee where angels know no night
    The song of praise forever rings.
    To Him who sits upon the throne,
    The Lamb once slain for sinful men,
    Be honor, might, all by Him won,
    Glory and praise! Amen, Amen.

[2] Deep in the prophets' sacred page,
    Grand in the poets' winged word,
    Slowly, in type, from age to age,
    Nations beheld their coming Lord,
    Till through the deep Judean night
    Rang out the song "Good will to men!"
    Hymned by the firstborn sons of light,
    Reechoed now, "Good will!" Amen.

[3] That life of truth, those deeds of love,
    That death of pain mid hate and scorn--
    These all are past, and now above
    He reigns, our King, once crowned with thorn.
    Lift up your heads, ye heav'nly gates!
    So sang His hosts, unheard by men.
    Lift up your heads, for you He waits.
    We lift them up. Amen, Amen.

[4] Nations afar, in ign'rance deep,
    Isles of the sea, where darkness lay,
    These hear His voice, they wake from sleep,
    And throng with joy the upward way.
    They cry with us, "Send forth Thy light,
    O Lamb, once slain for sinful men!
    Burst Satan's bonds, O God of might;
    Set all men free!" Amen, Amen.

[5] Sing to the Lord a glorious song;
    Sing to His name, His love forthtell!
    Sing on, heav'n's host, His praise prolong,
    Sing, ye who now on earth do dwell!
    Worthy the Lamb for sinners slain!
    From angels praise and thanks from men!
    Worthy the Lamb, enthroned to reign,
    Glory and pow'r! Amen, Amen.
    Amen
