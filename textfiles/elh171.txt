Hymn #171 - O Word of God Incarnate
Tune: MUNICH
File: elh171.txt

[1] O Word of God incarnate,
    O Wisdom from on high,
    O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
    O Light of our dark sky,
    We praise You for the radiance
    That from the hallowed page,
    A lamp unto our footsteps,
    Shines on from age to age.

[2] The Church from You, dear Master,
    Received the gift divine;
    And still that light is lifted
    O'er all the earth to shine.
    It is the chart and compass
    That, all life's voyage through,
    Mid mists and rocks and quicksands
    Still guides, O Christ, to You.

[3] O make Your Church, dear Savior,
    A lamp of burnished gold
    To bear before the nations
    Your true light, as of old;
    O teach Your wand'ring pilgrims
    By this their path to trace
    Till, clouds and darkness ended,
    They see You face to face.
    Amen
