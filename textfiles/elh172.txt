Hymn #172 - Songs of Thankfulness and Praise
Tune: SALZBURG
File: elh172.txt

[1] Songs of thankfulness and praise,
    Jesus, Lord, to Thee we raise;
    Manifested by the star
    To the sages from afar,
    Branch of royal David's stem
    In Thy birth at Bethlehem:
    Anthems be to Thee addressed,
    Word in flesh made manifest.

[2] Manifest at Jordan's stream,
    Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;
    And at Cana wedding Guest
    In thy Godhead manifest;
    Manifest in pow'r divine,
    Changing water into wine;
    Anthems be to Thee addressed,
    God in flesh made manifest.

[3] Manifest in making whole
    Palsied limbs and fainting soul;
    Manifest in valiant fight,
    Quelling all the devil's might;
    Manifest in gracious will,
    Ever bringing good from ill;
    Anthems be to Thee addressed,
    God in flesh made manifest.

[4] Grant us grace to see Thee, Lord,
    Mirrored in Thy holy Word;
    May we imitate Thee now
    And be pure, as pure art Thou;
    That we might become like thee
    At Thy great epiphany,
    And may praise Thee, ever blest,
    God in flesh made manifest.
    Amen
