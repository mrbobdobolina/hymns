Hymn #173 - The Star Proclaims the King Is Here
Tune: WO GOTT ZUM HAUS
File: elh173.txt

[1] The star proclaims the King is here;
    But, Herod, why this senseless fear?
    He takes no realms of earth away
    Who gives the realms of heav'nly day.

[2] The wiser Magi see from far
    And follow on His guiding star;
    And, led by light, to Light they press
    And by their gifts their God confess.

[3] Within the Jordan's crystal flood
    In meekness stands the Lamb of God
    And, sinless, sanctifies the wave,
    Mankind from sin to cleanse and save.

[4] At Cana first His pow'r is shown;
    His might the blushing waters own
    And, changing as He speaks the word,
    Flow wine, obedient to their Lord.

[5] All glory, Jesus, be to Thee
    For this Thy glad epiphany;
    Whom with the Father we adore
    And Holy Ghost forevermore.
    Amen
