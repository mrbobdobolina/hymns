[1] God loves me dearly,
    Grants me salvation,
    God loves me dearly,
    Loves even me.

[Refrain] Therefore I'll say again:
          God loves me dearly,
          God loves me dearly,
          Loves even me.

[2] I was in slav'ry,
    Sin, death, and darkness;
    God's love was working
    To make me free.

[Refrain] Therefore I'll say again:
          God loves me dearly,
          God loves me dearly,
          Loves even me.

[3] He sent forth Jesus,
    My dear Redeemer,
    He sent forth Jesus
    And set me free.

[Refrain] Therefore I'll say again:
          God loves me dearly,
          God loves me dearly,
          Loves even me.

[4] Jesus, my Savior,
    Himself did offer;
    Jesus, my Savior,
    Paid all I owed.

[Refrain] Therefore I'll say again:
          God loves me dearly,
          God loves me dearly,
          Loves even me.

[5] Now I will praise You,
    O Love Eternal;
    Now I will praise You
    All my life long.

[Refrain] Therefore I'll say again:
          God loves me dearly,
          God loves me dearly,
          Loves even me.
          Amen
