Hymn #176 - How Shall the Young Secure Their Hearts
Tune: AZMON
File: elh176.txt

[1] How shall the young secure their hearts,
    And guard their lives from sin?
    Thy Word the choicest rules imparts
    To keep the conscience clean.

[2] 'Tis, like the sun, a heav'nly light
    That guides us all the day,
    And through the dangers of the night
    A lamp to lead our way.

[3] The starry heav'ns Thy rule obey;
    The earth maintains her place;
    And these Thy servant night and day
    Thy skill and pow'r express.

[4] But still Thy law and gospel, Lord,
    Have lessons more divine;
    Not earth stands firmer than Thy Word
    Nor stars so nobly shine.

[5] Thy Word is everlasting truth;
    How pure is ev'ry page!
    That holy Book shall guide our youth
    And well support our age.
    Amen
