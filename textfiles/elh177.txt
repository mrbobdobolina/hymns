Hymn #177 - I Am Jesus' Little Lamb
Tune: WEIL ICH JESU SCHAFLEIN BIN
File: elh177.txt

[1] I am Jesus' little lamb,
    Ever glad at heart I am,
    For my Shepherd gently guides me,
    Knows my need, and well provides me,
    Loves me ev'ry day the same,
    Even calls me by my name.

[2] Day by day, at home, away,
    Jesus is my Staff and Stay.
    When I hunger, Jesus feeds me,
    Into pleasant pastures leads me;
    When I thirst, He bids me go
    Where the quiet waters flow.

[3] Who so happy as I am,
    Even now the Shepherd's lamb?
    And when my short life is ended,
    By His angel host attended,
    He shall fold me to His breast,
    There within His arms to rest.
    Amen
