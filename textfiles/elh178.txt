Tune: JEG VIL MIG HERREN LOVE
File: elh178.txt

[1] I pray Thee, dear Lord Jesus,
    My heart to keep and train
    That I Thy holy temple
    From youth to age remain.
    Turn Thou my thoughts forever
    From worldly wisdom's lore;
    If I but learn to know Thee,
    I shall not want for more.
    Amen
