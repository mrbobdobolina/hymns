Hymn #184 - My Faith Looks Up to Thee
Tune: OLIVET
File: elh184.txt

[1] My faith looks up to Thee,
    Thou Lamb of Calvary,
    Savior divine.
    Now hear me while I pray;
    Take all my guilt away;
    O let me from this day
    Be wholly Thine!

[2] May Thy rich grace impart
    Strength to my fainting heart;
    My zeal inspire!
    As Thou hast died for me,
    O may my love to Thee
    Pure, warm, and changeless be,
    A living fire!

[3] While life's dark maze I tread
    And griefs around me spread,
    Be Thou my Guide.
    Bid darkness turn to day,
    Wipe sorrow's tears away,
    Nor let me ever stray
    From Thee aside.

[4] When ends life's transient dream,
    When death's cold, sullen stream
    Shall o'er me roll,
    Blest Savior, then, in love,
    Fear and distrust remove;
    O bear me safe above,
    A ransomed soul!
    Amen
