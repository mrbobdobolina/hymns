Hymn #185 - Within the Father's House
Tune: FRANCONIA
File: elh185.txt

[1] Within the Father's house
    The Son has found His home,
    And to His temple suddenly
    The Lord of Life hath come.

[2] The doctors of the Law
    Gaze on the wondrous Child
    And marvel at His gracious words
    Of wisdom undefiled.

[3] Yet not to them is giv'n
    The mighty truth to know,
    To lift the earthly veil which hides
    Incarnate God below.

[4] The secret of the Lord
    Escapes each human eye,
    And faithful pond'ring hearts await
    The full epiphany.

[5] Lord, visit Thou our souls
    And teach us by Thy grace
    Each dim revealing of Thyself
    With loving awe to trace,

[6] Till from our darkened sight
    The cloud shall pass away
    And on the cleansed soul shall burst
    The everlasting day,

[7] Till we behold Thy face
    And know as we are known
    Thee, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
    Coequal Three in One.
    Amen
