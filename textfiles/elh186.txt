Hymn #186 - Ye Parents, Hear What Jesus Taught
Tune: TENDER THOUGHT
File: elh186.txt

[1] Ye parents, hear what Jesus taught
    When little ones to Him were brought:
    "Forbid them not, but heed My plea,
    And ever let them come to Me."

[2] Obey your Lord, and let His truth
    Be taught your children in their youth
    That in the church they thus may dwell
    And learn their Savior's praise to tell.

[3] For if you love them as you ought,
    To Christ your children will be brought.
    If thus you place them in His care,
    You and your household well shall fare.
    Amen
