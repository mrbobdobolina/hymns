Hymn #189 - In House and Home
Tune: KOMMT HER ZU MIR
File: elh189.txt

[1] In house and home where man and wife
    Together lead a godly life,
    By deeds their faith confessing!
    There many a happy day is spent;
    There Jesus gladly will consent
    To tarry with His blessing.

[2] If thou hast given Him thine heart,
    The place of honor set apart
    For Him each night and morrow,
    Then He the storms of life will calm,
    Will bring for ev'ry wound a balm,
    And change to joy thy sorrow.

[3] And if thy home be dark and drear,
    The cruse be empty, hunger near,
    All hope within thee dying;
    Despair not in thy sore distress,
    Lo, Christ is there the bread to bless,
    The fragments multiplying.

[4] O Lord, we come before Thy face;
    In ev'ry home bestow Thy grace
    On children, father, mother.
    Relieve their wants, their burdens ease,
    Let them together dwell in peace
    And love to one another!
    Amen
