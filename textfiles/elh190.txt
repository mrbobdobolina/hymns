Hymn #190 - O Blest the House, Whate'er Befall
Tune: WO GOTT ZUM HAUS
File: elh190.txt

[1] O blest the house, whate'er befall,
    Where Jesus Christ is all in all!
    Yea, if He were not dwelling there,
    How dark and poor and void it were!

[2] O blest that house where faith ye find
    And all within have set their mind
    To trust their God and serve Him still
    And do in all His holy will.

[3] O blest the parents who give heed
    Unto their children's foremost need
    And weary not of care or cost.
    May none to them and heav'n be lost!

[4] Blest such a house; it prospers well.
    In peace and joy the parents dwell,
    And in their children's lot is shown
    How richly God can bless His own.

[5] Then here will I and mine today
    A solemn cov'nant make and say:
    Though all the world forsake Thy Word,
    I and my house will serve the Lord.
    Amen
