Hymn #191 - Hark! The Voice of Jesus Crying
Tune: GALILEAN
File: elh191.txt

[1] Hark! The voice of Jesus crying,
    "Who will go and work today?
    Fields are ripe and harvests waiting;
    Who will bear the sheaves away?"
    Loud and long the Master calleth;
    Rich reward He offers thee.
    Who will answer, gladly saying,
    "Here am I, send me, send me"?

[2] If you cannot speak like angels,
    If you cannot preach like Paul,
    You can tell the love of Jesus;
    You can say He died for all.
    If you cannot rouse the wicked
    With the Judgment's dread alarms,
    You can lead the little children
    To the Savior's waiting arms.

[3] If you cannot be a watchman,
    Standing high on Zion's wall,
    Pointing out the path to heaven,
    Off'ring life and peace to all,
    With your prayers and with your off'rings
    You can do what God demands;
    You can be like faithful Aaron,
    Holding up the prophet's hands.

[4] Let none hear you idly saying,
    "There is nothing I can do,"
    While the multitudes are dying
    And the Master calls for you.
    Take the task He gives you gladly;
    Let His work your pleasure be.
    Answer quickly when He calleth,
    "Here am I, send me, send me!"
    Amen
