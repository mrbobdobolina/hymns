Hymn #192 - How Beauteous Are Their Feet
Tune: CARLISLE
File: elh192.txt

[1] How beauteous are their feet,
    Who stand on Zion's hill!
    Who bring salvation on their tongues,
    And words of peace reveal.

[2] How charming is their voice!
    How sweet the tidings are!
    "Zion, behold thy Savior King,
    He reigns and triumphs here."

[3] How happy are our ears,
    That hear this joyful sound,
    Which kings and prophets waited for,
    And sought, but never found.

[4] How blessed are our eyes,
    That see this heav'nly light!
    Prophets and kings desired it long,
    But died without the sight.

[5] The watchmen join their voice,
    And tuneful notes employ;
    Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
    And deserts learn the joy.

[6] The Lord makes bare His arm
    Through all the earth abroad;
    Let all the nations now behold
    Their Savior and their God.
    Amen
