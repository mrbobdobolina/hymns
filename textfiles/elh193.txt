Hymn #193 - Jesus Shall Reign Where'er the Sun
Tune: DUKE STREET
File: elh193.txt

[1] Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
    Does its successive journeys run;
    His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
    Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

[2] For Him shall endless prayer be made,
    And endless praises crown His head;
    His name, like sweet perfume, shall rise
    With ev'ry morning sacrifice.

[3] People and realms of ev'ry tongue
    Dwell on His love with sweetest song;
    And infant voices shall proclaim
    Their early blessings on His name.

[4] Blessings abound where'er He reigns:
    The pris'ner leaps, unloosed his chains,
    The weary find eternal rest,
    And all the sons of want are blest.

[5] Where He displays His healing pow'r,
    Death and the curse are known no more;
    In Him the tribes of Adam boast
    More blessings than their father lost.

[6] Let ev'ry creature rise and bring
    Peculiar honors to our King;
    Angels descend with songs again,
    And earth repeat the loud Amen.
    Amen
