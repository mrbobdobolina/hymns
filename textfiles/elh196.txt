Hymn #196 - Thy Hand, O God, Has Guided
Tune: AURELIA
File: elh196.txt

[1] Thy hand, O God, has guided
    Thy flock from age to age;
    The wondrous tale is written,
    Full clear, on ev'ry page;
    Our fathers owned Thy goodness,
    And we their deeds record,
    And both of this bear witness,
    One Church, one Faith, one Lord.

[2] Thy heralds brought glad tidings
    To greatest, as to least;
    They bade men rise, and hasten
    To share the great King's feast;
    And this was all their teaching,
    In ev'ry deed and word,
    To all alike proclaiming,
    One Church, one Faith, one Lord.

[3] Through many a day of darkness,
    Through many a scene of strife,
    The faithful few fought bravely
    To guard the nation's life.
    Their Gospel of redemption,
    Sin pardoned, man restored,
    Was all in this enfolded,
    One Church, one Faith, one Lord.

[4] And we, shall we be faithless?
    Shall hearts fail, hands hang down?
    Shall we evade the conflict,
    And cast away our crown?
    Not so; in God's deep counsels
    Some better thing is stored;
    We will maintain, unflinching,
    One Church, one Faith, one Lord.

[5] Thy mercy will not fail us,
    Nor leave Thy work undone;
    With Thy right hand to help us,
    The vict'ry shall be won;
    And then by men and angels
    Thy name shall be adored,
    And this shall be their anthem,
    One Church, one Faith, one Lord.
    Amen
