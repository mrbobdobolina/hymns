Hymn #197 - My Hope Is Built
Tune: MAGDALEN
File: elh197.txt

[1] My hope is built on nothing less
    Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
    I dare not trust the sweetest frame
    But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

[Refrain] On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
          All other ground is sinking sand.

[2] When darkness veils His lovely face,
    I rest on His unchanging grace;
    In ev'ry high and stormy gale
    My anchor holds within the veil.

[Refrain] On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
          All other ground is sinking sand.

[3] His oath, His covenant, and blood
    Support me in the whelming flood;
    When ev'ry earthly prop gives way,
    He then is all my Hope and Stay.

[Refrain] On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
          All other ground is sinking sand.

[4] When He shall come with trumpet sound,
    O may I then in Him be found,
    Clothed in His righteousness alone,
    Faultless to stand before the throne.

[Refrain] On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
          All other ground is sinking sand.
          Amen
