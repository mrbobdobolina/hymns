Tune: O JESU CHRISTE, WAHRES LICHT
File: elh198.txt

[1] O Christ, our true and only Light,
    Enlighten those who sit in night;
    Let those afar now hear Thy voice
    And in Thy fold with us rejoice.

[2] Fill with the radiance of Thy grace
    The souls now lost in error's maze
    And all whom in their secret minds
    Some dark delusion haunts and blinds.

[3] O gently call those gone astray
    That they may find the saving way!
    Let ev'ry conscience sore oppressed
    In Thee find peace and heav'nly rest.

[4] O make the deaf to hear Thy Word
    And teach the dumb to speak, dear Lord,
    Who dare not yet the faith avow,
    Though secretly they hold it now.

[5] Shine on the darkened and the cold;
    Recall the wand'rers to Thy fold.
    Unite all those who walk apart;
    Confirm the weak and doubting heart.

[6] So they with us may evermore
    Such grace with wond'ring thanks adore
    And endless praise to Thee be giv'n
    By all Thy Church in earth and heav'n.
    Amen
