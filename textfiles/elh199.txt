Hymn #199 - Rise, Thou Light of Gentile Nations
Tune: O DU LIEBE MEINER LIEBE
File: elh199.txt

[1] Rise, Thou Light of Gentile nations,
    Jesus, bright and Morning Star;
    Let Thy Word, the gladsome tidings,
    Ring out loudly near and far,
    Bringing freedom to the captives,
    Peace and comfort to the slave,
    That the heathen, free from bondage,
    May proclaim Thy pow'r to save.

[2] See the blindness of the heathen,
    Strangers to Thy glorious light,
    Straying hopeless till they find Thee,
    Wand'ring aimless in the night.
    See their pitiful condition;
    Lo, gross darkness covers all,
    And no ray of hope refreshes
    Nor dispels the dreadful pall.

[3] If Thou, merciful Redeemer,
    Hadst not saved us from this plight,
    In like darkness we should languish
    Hopeless, helpless, in sin's night.
    Lovingly Thou, Lord, didst seek us
    In the beauty of Thy grace;
    Now with joy we freely serve Thee,
    We, Thy blessed, chosen race.

[4] Knowing Thee and Thy salvation,
    Grateful love dare never cease
    To proclaim Thy tender mercies,
    Gracious Lord, Thy heav'nly peace.
    Sound we forth the Gospel tidings
    To the earth's remotest bound
    That the sinner has been pardoned
    And forgiveness can be found.

[5] May our zeal to help the heathen
    Be increased from day to day
    As we plead in true compassion
    And for their conversion pray.
    For the many faithful heralds,
    For the Gospel they proclaim,
    Let us all be cheerful givers
    To the glory of Thy name.

[6] Savior, shine in all Thy glory
    On the nations near and far;
    From the highways and the byways
    Call them, O Thou Morning Star.
    Guide them whom Thy grace hath chosen
    Out of Satan's dreadful thrall
    To the mansions of Thy Father--
    There is room for sinners all.
    Amen
