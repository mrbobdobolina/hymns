Tune: DER MANGE SKAL KOMME
File: elh200.txt

[1] There many shall come from the east and the west
    And sit at the feast of salvation
    With Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the blest,
    Obeying the Lord's invitation.

[Refrain] Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

[2] But they who have always resisted His grace
    And on their own virtue depended,
    Shall then be condemned and cast out from His face,
    Eternally lost and unfriended.

[Refrain] Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

[3] O may we all hear when our Shepherd doth call,
    In accents persuasive and tender,
    That while there is time we make haste one and all
    And find Him, our mighty Defender.

[Refrain] Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

[4] O that we the throng of the ransomed may swell,
    To whom He hath granted remission.
    God graciously make us in heaven to dwell
    And save us from endless perdition.

[Refrain] Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

[5] God grant that I may of His infinite love
    Remain in His merciful keeping;
    And sit with the King at His table above,
    When here in the grave I am sleeping.

[Refrain] Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

[6] All trials are then like a dream that is past,
    Forgotten all trouble and sorrow;
    All questions and doubts have been answered at last;
    Then dawneth eternity's morrow.

[Refrain] Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!

[7] The heavens shall ring with an anthem more grand
    Than ever on earth was recorded;
    The blest of the Lord shall receive at His hand
    The crown to the victors awarded.

[Refrain] Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!
          Amen
