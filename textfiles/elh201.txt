Hymn #201 - Spread, O Spread, Thou Mighty Word
Tune: VIENNA
File: elh201.txt

[1] Spread, O spread, thou mighty Word,
    Spread the kingdom of the Lord,
    Wheresoe'er His breath has giv'n
    Life to beings meant for heav'n.

[2] Tell them how the Father's will
    Made the world, and keeps it still,
    How His only Son He gave,
    Man from sin and death to save.

[3] Tell of our Redeemer's love,
    Who for ever doth remove
    By His holy sacrifice
    All the guilt that on us lies.

[4] Tell them of the Spirit giv'n
    Now to guide us up to heav'n.
    Strong and holy, just and true,
    Working both to will and do.

[5] Word of life, most pure and strong,
    Lo, for Thee the nations long;
    Spread, till from its dreary night
    All the world awakes to light.

[6] Up! the rip'ning fields ye see,
    Mighty shall the harvest be;
    But the reapers still are few,
    Great the work they have to do.

[7] Lord of harvest, let there be
    Joy and strength to work for Thee,
    Till the nations, far and near,
    See Thy light, and learn Thy fear.
    Amen
