Hymn #202 - Thou, Whose Almighty Word
Tune: ITALIAN HYMN
File: elh202.txt

[1] Thou, whose almighty Word
    Chaos and darkness heard
    And took their flight:
    Hear us, we humbly pray,
    And where the Gospel day
    Sheds not its glorious ray,
    Let there be light!

[2] Thou who didst come to bring,
    On Thy redeeming wing,
    Healing and sight,
    Health to the sick in mind,
    Sight to the inly blind:
    O now, to humankind
    Let there be light!

[3] Spirit of truth and love,
    Life-giving, holy Dove,
    Speed forth Thy flight;
    Move on the waters' face,
    Spreading the lamp of grace,
    And in earth's darkest place
    Let there be light!

[4] Holy and blessed Three,
    Glorious Trinity,
    Wisdom, Love, Might!
    Boundless as ocean's tide,
    Rolling in fullest pride,
    Through the earth, far and wide,
    Let there be light!
    Amen
