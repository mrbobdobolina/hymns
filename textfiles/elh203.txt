Hymn #203 - All My Hope on God Is Founded
Tune: MICHAEL
File: elh203.txt

[1] All my hope on God is founded;
    He doth still my trust renew,
    Me through change and chance He guideth,
    Only good and only true.
    God unknown, He alone
    Calls my heart to be His own.

[2] Mortal pride and earthly glory,
    Sword and crown betray our trust;
    Though with care and toil we build them,
    Tow'r and temple fall to dust.
    But God's pow'r, Hour by hour,
    Is my temple and my tow'r.

[3] Daily doth th' almighty Giver
    Bounteous gifts on us bestow;
    His desire our soul delighteth,
    Pleasure leads us where we go.
    Love doth stand At His hand;
    Joy doth wait on His command.

[4] Still from earth to God eternal
    Sacrifice of praise be done,
    High above all praises praising
    For the gift of Christ, His Son.
    Christ doth call One and all:
    Ye who follow shall not fall.
    Amen
