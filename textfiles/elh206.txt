Tune: STEPHANOS
File: elh206.txt

[1] I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
    Trusting only Thee;
    Trusting Thee for full salvation,
    Great and free.

[2] I am trusting Thee for pardon;
    At Thy feet I bow,
    For Thy grace and tender mercy
    Trusting now.

[3] I am trusting Thee for cleansing
    In the crimson flood,
    Trusting Thee to make me holy
    By Thy blood.

[4] I am trusting Thee to guide me;
    Thou alone shalt lead,
    Ev'ry day and hour supplying
    All my need.

[5] I am trusting Thee for power;
    Thine can never fail.
    Words which Thou Thyself shalt give me
    Must prevail.

[6] I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;
    Never let me fall.
    I am trusting Thee forever
    And for all.
    Amen
