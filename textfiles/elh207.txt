Hymn #207 - Seek Where Ye May to Find a Way
Tune: SUCH, WER DA WILL
File: elh207.txt

[1] Seek where ye may
    To find a way
    That leads to your salvation.
    My heart is stilled;
    On Christ I build,
    He is the one Foundation.
    His Word is sure;
    His works endure.
    He doth o'erthrow
    My ev'ry foe;
    Through Him I more than conquer.

[2] Seek whom ye may
    To be your stay;
    None can redeem his brother.
    All helpers failed;
    This Man prevailed,
    The God-man, and none other.
    Our Servant-Lord
    Did help afford;
    We're justified,
    For He hath died,
    The guiltless for the guilty.

[3] Seek Him alone,
    Who did atone,
    Who did your souls deliver;
    Yea, seek Him first,
    All ye who thirst
    For grace that faileth never.
    In ev'ry need
    Seek Him indeed;
    To ev'ry heart
    He will impart
    His blessings without measure.

[4] My heart's Delight,
    My Crown most bright,
    Thou, Jesus, art forever.
    Nor wealth nor pride
    Nor aught beside
    Our bond of love shall sever.
    Thou art my Lord;
    Thy precious Word
    Shall be my guide,
    Whate'er betide.
    O teach me, Lord, to trust Thee!

[5] Hide not from me,
    I ask of Thee,
    Thy gracious face and favor.
    Though floods of woe
    Should o'er me flow,
    My faith shall never waver.
    From pain and grief
    Grant sweet relief;
    For tears I weep,
    Lord, let me reap
    Thy heav'nly joy and glory.
    Amen
