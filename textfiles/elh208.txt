Hymn #208 - Thy Way and All Thy Sorrows
Tune: BEFIEHL DU DEINE WEGE
File: elh208.txt

[1] Thy way and all thy sorrows,
    Give thou into His hand,
    His gracious care unfailing,
    Who doth the heav'ns command;
    Their course and path He giveth
    To clouds and air and wind:
    A way thy feet may follow
    He, too, for thee will find.

[2] On Him be thy reliance,
    If thou would'st prosper well;
    To make thy work enduring
    Thy mind on Him must dwell.
    God yieldeth naught to sorrow
    And self-tormenting care;
    Naught, naught with Him availeth,
    No pow'r save that of pray'r.

[3] Thy truth and grace, O Father,
    Behold and surely know,
    Both what is good and evil,
    For mortal man below;
    And whatsoe'er Thou choosest
    Thou dost, great God, fulfill,
    And into being bringest
    Whate'er is in Thy will.

[4] Thy way is ever open;
    Thou dost on naught depend;
    Thine act is only blessing,
    Thy path light without end.
    Thy work can no man hinder;
    Thy purpose none can stay,
    Since Thou to bless Thy children
    Through all dost make a way.

[5] In vain the pow'rs of darkness
    Thy will, O God, oppose;
    High over all undoubting,
    Thy pleasure onward goes.
    Whate'er Thy will resolveth,
    Whate'er Thou dost intend,
    Its destined work performeth
    True to its aim and end.

[6] Then hope, my feeble spirit,
    And be thou undismayed;
    God helps in ev'ry trial,
    And makes thee unafraid.
    Await God's time with pleasure,
    Then shall thine eyes behold
    The sun of joy and gladness
    His brightest beams unfold.

[7] Arise, arise! thy sadness,
    Thy cares send far away;
    Away each thought afflicting
    That on the heart doth prey.
    Not in thy hands the guidance
    Of all events doth dwell;
    God on His throne o'erruleth,
    He guideth all things well.

[8] Leave all to His direction,
    In wisdom He doth reign;
    Thy wonder far exceeding,
    He will His course maintain.
    So He as Him beseemeth
    His wonder-working skill,
    Shall put away the sorrows,
    That now thy spirit fill.

[9] Awhile His consolation
    He will to thee deny,
    And seem as though in spirit
    He far from thee would fly;
    Awhile distress and anguish
    Shall compass thee around,
    Nor to thy supplication
    An answ'ring voice be found,

[10] But if thou ne'er forsake Him,
     Thou shalt deliv'rance find;
     Behold all unexpected,
     He will thy soul unbind.
     He from thy heavy burden
     Will soon thy heart set free;
     Yea, from that weight no evil
     Hath yet befallen thee.

[11] Thou child of truth, how blessed!
     A conqu'ror soon shalt be,
     With songs of glad thanksgiving
     A crown awaiteth thee.
     To thee the palm triumphal
     By God's own hand is giv'n,
     Thine, to His name who saved thee,
     To sing the songs of heav'n.

[12] Give, Lord, this consummation
     To all our heart's distress,
     Our hands, our feet, O strengthen,
     In death our spirits bless.
     Thy truth and Thy protection
     Forevermore we pray;
     With these in heav'nly glory
     Shall end our certain way.
     Amen
