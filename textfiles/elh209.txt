Hymn #209 - Jesus, Lover of My Soul
Tune: ABERYSTWYTH
File: elh209.txt

[1] Jesus, Lover of my soul,
    Let me to Thy bosom fly
    While the nearer waters roll,
    While the tempest still is high.
    Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
    Till the storm of life is past;
    Safe into the haven guide.
    O receive my soul at last!

[2] Other refuge have I none;
    Hangs my helpless soul on Thee.
    Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
    Still support and comfort me!
    All my trust on Thee is stayed,
    All my help from Thee I bring;
    Cover my defenseless head
    With the shadow of Thy wing.

[3] Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
    More than all in Thee I find.
    Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
    Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
    Just and holy is Thy name;
    I am all unrighteousness,
    False and full of sin I am;
    Thou art full of truth and grace.

[4] Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
    Grace to cover all my sin.
    Let the healing streams abound;
    Make and keep me pure within.
    Thou of life the Fountain art,
    Freely let me take of Thee;
    Spring Thou up within my heart,
    Rise to all eternity.
    Amen
