Hymn #212 - Lord Jesus, Thou the Church's Head
Tune: REUTER
File: elh212.txt

[1] Lord Jesus, Thou the Church's Head,
    Thou art her one Foundation.
    In Thee she trusts, before Thee bows,
    And waits for Thy salvation.
    Built on this rock secure,
    Thy Church shall endure
    E'en though the world decay
    And all things pass away.
    O hear, O hear us, Jesus!

[2] O Lord, let this, Thy little flock,
    Thy name alone confessing,
    Continue in Thy loving care,
    True unity possessing.
    Thy sacraments, O Lord,
    And Thy saving Word
    To us e'er pure retain.
    Grant that they may remain
    Our only strength and comfort.

[3] Help us to serve Thee evermore
    With hearts both pure and lowly.
    And may Thy Word, that light divine,
    Shine on in splendor holy
    That we repentance show,
    In faith ever grow.
    The pow'r of sin destroy
    And all that doth annoy.
    O make us faithful Christians!

[4] And for Thy gospel let us dare
    To sacrifice all treasure;
    Teach us to bear Thy blessed cross,
    To find in Thee all pleasure.
    O grant us steadfastness
    In joy and distress,
    Lest we Thee ne'er forsake.
    Let us by grace partake
    Of endless joy and glory.
    Amen
