Hymn #213 - O Lord, Our Father
Tune: HERZLIEBSTER JESU
File: elh213.txt

[1] O Lord, our Father, shall we be confounded
    Who, though by trials and by woes surrounded,
    On Thee alone for help are still relying,
    To Thee are crying?

[2] Lord, put to shame Thy foes who breathe defiance
    And vainly make their might their sole reliance;
    In mercy turn to us, the poor and stricken,
    Our hope to quicken.

[3] Be Thou our Helper and our strong Defender;
    Speak to our foes and cause them to surrender.
    Yea, long before their plans have been completed,
    They are defeated.

[4] 'Tis vain to trust in man; for Thou, Lord, only
    Art the Defense and Comfort of the lonely.
    With Thee to lead, the battle shall be glorious
    And we victorious.

[5] Thou art our Hero, all our foes subduing;
    Save Thou Thy little flock they are pursuing.
    We seek Thy help; for Jesus' sake be near us.
    Great Helper, hear us!
    Amen
