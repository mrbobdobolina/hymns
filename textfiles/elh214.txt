Hymn #214 - Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken
Tune: HYMN TO JOY
File: elh214.txt

[1] Glorious things of thee are spoken,
    Zion, city of our God;
    He whose word cannot be broken
    Formed thee for His own abode.
    On the Rock of Ages founded,
    What can shake thy sure repose?
    With salvation's walls surrounded,
    Thou may smile at all thy foes.

[2] See, the streams of living waters
    Springing from eternal love,
    Well supply thy sons and daughters
    And all fear of want remove.
    Who can faint while such a river
    Ever will their thirst assuage--
    Grace which, like the Lord, the Giver,
    Never fails from age to age?

[3] Round each habitation hov'ring,
    See the cloud and fire appear,
    For a glory and a cov'ring,
    Showing that the Lord is near.
    Thus they march, the pillar leading,
    Light by night and shade by day,
    Daily on the manna feeding
    Which He gives them when they pray.

[4] Savior, since of Zion's city
    I through grace a member am,
    Let the world deride or pity,
    I will glory in Thy name.
    Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
    All his boasted pomp and show;
    Solid joys and lasting treasure
    None by Zion's children know.
    Amen
