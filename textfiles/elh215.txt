Hymn #215 - O Father, May Thy Word Prevail
Tune: AK, FADER, LAD DIT ORD
File: elh215.txt

[1] O Father, may Thy Word prevail
    Against the gates of hell!
    Behold the vineyard Thou hast tilled
    With thorns and thistles filled.
    'Tis true, Thy plants are there;
    But, ah, how weak and rare!
    How slight the pow'r in evidence
    Of Word and Sacraments!

[2] Come, Jesus, come and contemplate
    Thy vineyard's sad estate:
    Baptized are millions in Thy name,
    But where is faith's pure flame?
    Of what avail that we
    Know of Thine agony
    So long as we do not o'erthrow
    In faith the wicked foe?

[3] O Holy Ghost, to Thee, our light,
    We cry by day, by night:
    Come, grant us of the light and pow'r
    Our fathers had of yore;
    When Thy dear Church did stand
    A tree, deep-rooted, grand;
    Full-crowned with blossoms white as snow,
    With purple fruits aglow!
    Amen
