Hymn #216 - Of Zion's Honor Angels Sing
Tune: TRURO
File: elh216.txt

[1] Of Zion's honor angels sing!
    In Zion Christ alone is King;
    In grace He rules with gentle sway
    And leads her heav'nward day by day.

[2] For Zion's knows no other Lord,
    But cleaves to His unerring Word:
    To her suffices: Jesus saith!
    This is her source and rule of faith.

[3] To her He gave the Pow'r of Keys,
    To bind and loose as He decrees;
    Through her declares our sins forgiv'n
    That we may be fit heirs of heav'n.

[4] Apostles, prophets, He hath sent
    To her with Word and Sacrament,
    And still sends servants of the Word
    To serve the Church and Christ, her Lord.

[5] God Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
    Adored by all the heav'nly host,
    We bow in Zion at Thy throne--
    No other God and Lord we own.
    Amen
