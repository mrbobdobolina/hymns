Hymn #217 - Rise, Ye Children of Salvation
Tune: UNSER HERRSCHER
File: elh217.txt

[1] Rise, ye children of salvation,
    All who cleave to Christ the Head!
    Wake, awake, O mighty nation,
    Ere the foe on Zion tread;
    He draws nigh and would defy
    All the hosts of God Most High.

[2] Saints and martyrs long before us
    Firmly on this ground have stood;
    See their banner waving o'er us,
    Conqu'rors through the Savior's blood.
    Ground we hold, whereon of old,
    Fought the faithful and the bold.

[3] Fighting, we shall be victorious
    By the blood of Christ our Lord;
    On our foreheads, bright and glorious,
    Shines the witness of His Word;
    Spear and shield on battlefield,
    His great name; we cannot yield.

[4] When His servants stand before Him,
    Each receiving his reward;
    When His saints in light adore Him,
    Giving glory to the Lord;
    "Victory!" our song shall be,
    Like the thunder of the sea.
    Amen
