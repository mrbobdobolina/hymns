Hymn #218 - There Is a Safe and Secret Place
Tune: NEW BRITAIN
File: elh218.txt

[1] There is a safe and secret place
    Beneath the wings divine,
    Reserved for all the heirs of grace;
    O be that refuge mine!

[2] The least and feeblest there may bide
    In peace and safety sure;
    While thousands fall on ev'ry side,
    He rests in God secure.

[3] He feeds in pastures large and fair
    Of love and truth divine;
    O child of God, O glory's heir,
    How rich a lot is thine!

[4] A hand almighty to defend,
    An ear for ev'ry call,
    An honored life, a peaceful end,
    And heav'n to crown it all!
    Amen
