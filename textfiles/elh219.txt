Hymn #219 - Lord, as Thou Wilt, Deal Thou with Me
Tune: HERR, WIE DU WILLST
File: elh219.txt

[1] Lord, as Thou wilt, deal Thou with me;
    No other wish I cherish.
    In life and death I cling to Thee;
    O do not let me perish!
    Let not Thy grace from me depart
    And grant an ever patient heart
    To bear what Thou dost send me.

[2] Grant honor, truth, and purity,
    And love Thy Word to ponder;
    From all false doctrine keep me free.
    Bestow, both here and yonder,
    What serves my everlasting bliss;
    Preserve me from unrighteousness
    Throughout my earthly journey.

[3] When, at Thy summons, I must leave
    This vale of sin and sadness,
    Give me Thy grace, Lord, not to grieve,
    But to depart with gladness.
    To Thee my spirit I commend;
    O Lord, grant me a blessed end
    Through Jesus Christ, my Savior.
    Amen
