Tune: LIEBSTER JESU, WIR SIND HIER
File: elh220.txt

[1] From eternity, O God,
    In Thy Son Thou didst elect me.
    Therefore, Father, on life's road
    Graciously to heav'n direct me;
    Send to me Thy Holy Spirit
    That His gifts I may inherit.

[2] Though alive, I'm dead in sin,
    Lost to all good things by nature.
    Holy Ghost, change me within,
    Make of me a newborn creature;
    For the flesh works ruination
    And can never gain salvation.

[3] Drive away the gloomy night
    Of my heart's perverse reflection.
    Quench all thoughts that are not right;
    Hold my reason in subjection;
    Grant that I from Thee, with yearning,
    Wisdom always may be learning.

[4] All desire and thoughts of mine
    From my youth are only evil.
    Save me by Thy pow'r divine
    From myself and from the devil;
    Give me strength in ample measure
    Both to will and do Thy pleasure.

[5] O create a heart in me
    That in Thee, my God believeth
    And o'er the iniquity
    Of my sins most truly grieveth.
    When dark hours of woe betide me,
    In the wounds of Jesus hide me.

[6] As a branch upon a vine,
    In my blessed Lord implant me;
    Ever of my Head divine
    To remain a member grant me.
    O let Him, my Lord and Savior,
    Be my Life and Love forever!

[7] Faith and hope and charity
    Graciously, O Father, give me;
    Be my Guardian constantly
    That the devil may not grieve me.
    Grant me humbleness and gladness,
    Peace and patience in my sadness.

[8] Help me speak what's right and good
    And keep silence on occasion.
    Help me pray, Lord, as I should,
    Help me bear my tribulation.
    Help me die and let my spirit
    Everlasting life inherit.
    Amen
