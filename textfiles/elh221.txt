Hymn #221 - Thine Honor Save
Tune: ERHALT UNS, HERR
File: elh221.txt

[1] Thine honor save, O Christ, our Lord!
    Hear Zion's cries and help afford;
    Destroy the wiles of mighty foes
    Who now Thy Word and truth oppose.

[2] Their craft and pomp indeed are great,
    Thy holy Church they boldly hate,
    Our hope they scornfully deride
    And deem us nothing in their pride.

[3] Forgive, O Lord, our sins forgive;
    Grant us Thy grace and let us live.
    Convince Thy foes throughout the land
    That godless counsels shall not stand.

[4] That Thou art with us, Lord, proclaim
    And put our enemies to shame;
    Confound them in their haughtiness
    And help Thine own in their distress.

[5] Preserve Thy chosen flock in peace,
    Nor let Thy boundless mercy cease;
    To all the world let it appear
    That Thy true Church indeed is here.
    Amen
