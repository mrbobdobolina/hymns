Hymn #222 - Lord, 'Tis Not That I Did Choose Thee
Tune: O DU LIEBE MEINER LIEBE
File: elh222.txt

[1] Lord, 'tis not that I did choose Thee;
    That, I know, could never be,
    For this heart would still refuse Thee
    Had Thy grace not chosen me.
    Thou has from the sin that stained me
    Washed and cleansed and set me free
    And unto this end ordained me,
    That I ever live to Thee.

[2] 'Twas Thy grace in Christ that called me,
    Taught my darkened heart and mind,
    Else the world had yet enthralled me,
    To Thy heav'nly glories blind.
    Now my heart owns none above Thee;
    For Thy grace alone I thirst,
    Knowing well that, if I love Thee,
    Thou, O Lord, didst love me first.

[3] Praise the God of all creation;
    Praise the Father's boundless love.
    Praise the Lamb, our Expiation,
    Priest and King enthroned above.
    Praise the Spirit of salvation,
    Him by whom our spirits live.
    Undivided adoration
    To the great Jehovah give.
    Amen
