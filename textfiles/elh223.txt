Hymn #223 - O Wondrous Type
Tune: DEO GRACIAS
File: elh223.txt

[1] O wondrous type, O vision fair
    Of glory that the Church shall share,
    Which Christ upon the mountain shows,
    Where brighter than the sun He glows!

[2] From age to age the Word declares
    How with the three disciples there,
    Where Moses and Elijah meet,
    The Lord holds converse high and sweet.

[3] The law and prophets there have place,
    The chosen witnesses of grace;
    The Father's voice from out the cloud
    Proclaims His only Son aloud.

[4] With shining face and bright array
    Christ deigns to manifest today
    What glory shall be theirs above
    Who joy in God with perfect love.

[5] O Father, with the eternal Son
    And Holy Spirit, ever One,
    Vouchsafe to bring us by Thy grace
    To see Thy glory face to face.
    Amen
