Hymn #224 - The Only Son from Heaven
Tune: HERR CHRIST, DER EINIG GOTTS SOHN
File: elh224.txt

[1] The only Son from heaven,
    Foretold by ancient seers,
    By God the Father given,
    In human form appears;
    No sphere His light confining,
    No star so brightly shining
    As He, our Morning Star.

[2] O time of God appointed,
    O bright and holy morn!
    He comes, the King anointed,
    The Christ, the Virgin-born,
    His home on earth He maketh,
    And man of heav'n partaketh,
    Of life again an heir.

[3] O Lord, our hearts awaken
    To know and love Thee more,
    In faith to stand unshaken,
    In Spirit to adore,
    That we, still heav'nward hasting,
    Yet here Thy joy foretasting,
    May reap its fullness there.
    Amen
