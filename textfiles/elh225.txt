Hymn #225 - With Trembling Awe the Chosen Three
Tune: ES IST GEWISSLICH
File: elh225.txt

[1] With trembling awe the chosen three
    The holy mount ascended,
    Where, wrapped in blissful ecstacy,
    They saw the vision splendid--
    Their Lord arrayed in living light,
    And on His left hand and His right,
    By glorious saints attended.

[2] O vision bright, too bright to tell,
    The joys of heav'n unveiling!
    How precious on those hearts it fell,
    When earthly hopes were failing;
    When, saints no more on either side,
    Between the thieves the Savior died
    'Mid hate, and scorn, and railing!

[3] Grant us, dear Lord, some vision brief
    Of future triumph telling,
    Gilding with hope our night of grief,
    Our clouds of fear dispelling.
    If the dim foretaste was so bright,
    O what shall be the dazzling light
    Of thine eternal dwelling!
    Amen
