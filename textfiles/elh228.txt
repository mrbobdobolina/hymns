Tune: KINGSFOLD
File: elh228.txt

[1] Almighty God, Thy Word is cast
    Like seed into the ground;
    Now let the dew of heav'n descend
    And righteous fruits abound.
    Let not the foe of Christ and man
    This holy seed remove,
    But give it root in ev'ry heart
    To bring forth fruits of love.

[2] Let not the world's deceitful cares
    The rising plant destroy,
    But let it yield a hundredfold
    The fruits of peace and joy.
    Oft as the precious seed is sown,
    Thy quick'ning grace bestow
    That all whose souls the truth receive
    Its saving pow'r may know.
    Amen
