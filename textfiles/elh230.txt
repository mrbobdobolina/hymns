Hymn #230 - Speak, O Lord, Thy Servant Heareth
Tune: WERDE MUNTER
File: elh230.txt

[1] Speak, O Lord, Thy servant heareth,
    To Thy Word I now give heed;
    Life and spirit Thy Word beareth,
    All Thy Word is true indeed.
    Death's dread pow'r in me is rife;
    Jesus, may Thy Word of Life
    Fill my soul with love's strong fervor
    That I cling to Thee forever.

[2] O what blessing to be near Thee
    And to hearken to Thy voice!
    May I ever love and fear Thee
    That Thy Word may be my choice!
    Oft were hardened sinners, Lord,
    Struck with terror by Thy Word;
    But to him who for sin grieveth
    Comfort sweet and hope it giveth.

[3] Lord, Thy words are waters living
    Where I quench my thirsty need.
    Lord, Thy words are bread life-giving:
    On Thy words my soul doth feed.
    Lord, Thy words will be my light
    Through death's vale and dreary night;
    Yea, they are my sword prevailing
    And my cup of joy unfailing.

[4] Precious Jesus, I beseech Thee,
    May Thy words take root in me;
    May this gift from heav'n enrich me
    So that I bear fruit for Thee!
    Take them never from my heart
    Till I see Thee as Thou art,
    When in heav'nly bliss and glory
    I shall greet Thee and adore Thee.
    Amen
