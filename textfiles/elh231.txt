Hymn #231 - When Israel Through the Desert Passed
Tune: WINCHESTER NEW
File: elh231.txt

[1] When Israel through the desert passed,
    A fiery pillar went before
    To guide them through the dreary waste
    And lessen the fatigue they bore.

[2] Such is Thy glorious Word, O God!
    'Tis for our light and guidance giv'n;
    It sheds its luster all abroad
    And points the path to bliss and heav'n.

[3] It fills the soul with sweet delight
    The heart with living faith empow'rs;
    It sets our wand'ring footsteps right,
    Displays Thy love, and kindles ours.

[4] Its promises rejoice our hearts,
    Its doctrines are divinely true;
    While highest wisdom it imparts,
    It comforts and instructs us too.

[5] Ye favored lands that have this Word,
    Ye saints who feel its saving pow'r,
    Unite your tongues to praise the Lord
    And His distinguished grace adore!
    Amen
