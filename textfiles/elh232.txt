Hymn #232 - How Precious Is the Book Divine
Tune: SIROE
File: elh232.txt

[1] How precious is the Book Divine,
    By inspiration giv'n!
    Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine
    To guide our souls to heav'n,
    To guide our souls to heav'n.

[2] Its light, descending from above
    Our gloomy world to cheer,
    Displays a Savior's boundless love
    And brings His glories near,
    And brings His glories near.

[3] It shows to us our wand'ring ways
    And where our feet have trod,
    And brings to view the matchless grace
    Of a forgiving God,
    Of a forgiving God.

[4] O'er all the straight and narrow way
    Its radiant beams are cast;
    A light whose never weary ray
    Grows brightest at the last,
    Grows brightest at the last.

[5] It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts
    In this dark vale of tears.
    Life, light, and joy it still imparts
    And quells our rising fears,
    And quells our rising fears.

[6] This lamp through all the dreary night
    Of life shall guide our way
    Till we behold the clearer light
    Of an eternal day,
    Of an eternal day.
    Amen
