Hymn #233 - The Gospel Shows the Father's Grace
Tune: ROCKINGHAM OLD
File: elh233.txt

[1] The Gospel shows the Father's grace,
    Who sent His Son to save our race,
    Proclaims how Jesus lived and died
    That we might thus be justified.

[2] It sets the Lamb before our eyes,
    Who made th' atoning sacrifice,
    And calls the souls with guilt oppressed
    To come and find eternal rest.

[3] It brings the Savior's righteousness
    Our souls to robe in royal dress;
    From all our guilt it brings release
    And gives the troubled conscience peace.

[4] It is the pow'r of God to save
    From sin and Satan and the grave;
    It works the faith, which firmly clings
    To all the treasures which it brings.

[5] It bears to all the tidings glad
    And bids their hearts no more be sad;
    The heavy-laden souls it cheers
    And banishes their guilty fears.

[6] May we in faith its tidings learn
    Nor thanklessly its blessings spurn;
    May we in faith its truth confess
    And praise the Lord our Righteousness!
    Amen
