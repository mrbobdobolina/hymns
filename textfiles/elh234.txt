Hymn #234 - We Have a Sure Prophetic Word
Tune: WO GOTT ZUM HAUS
File: elh234.txt

[1] We have a sure prophetic Word
    By inspiration of the Lord;
    And though assailed on ev'ry hand,
    Jehovah's Word shall ever stand.

[2] By pow'rs of empire banned and burned,
    By pagan pride rejected, spurned,
    The Word still stands the Christian's trust
    While haughty empires lie in dust.

[3] Lo, what the Word in times of old
    Of future days and deeds foretold
    Is all fulfilled while ages roll,
    As traced on the prophetic scroll.

[4] Abiding, steadfast, firm, and sure
    The teachings of the Word endure.
    Blest all who trust this steadfast Word;
    His anchor holds in Christ, the Lord.
    Amen
