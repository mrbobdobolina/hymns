Hymn #236 - Let Us Ever Walk with Jesus
Tune: LASSET UNS MIT JESU ZIEHEN
File: elh236.txt

[1] Let us ever walk with Jesus,
    Follow His example pure,
    Flee the world, which would deceive us,
    And to sin our souls allure.
    Ever in His footsteps treading,
    Body here, yet soul above,
    Full of faith and hope and love,
    Let us do the Father's bidding.
    Faithful Lord, abide with me;
    Savior, lead, I follow Thee.

[2] Let us suffer here with Jesus,
    To His image e'er conform;
    Heaven's glory soon will please us,
    Sunshine follow on the storm.
    Though we sow in tears of sorrow,
    We shall reap in heav'nly joy;
    And the fears that now annoy
    Shall be laughter on the morrow.
    Christ, I suffer here with Thee;
    There, O share Thy joy with me!

[3] Let us also die with Jesus.
    His death from the second death,
    From our soul's destruction, frees us,
    Quickens us with life's glad breath.
    Let us mortify, while living,
    Flesh and blood and die to sin;
    And the grave that shuts us in
    Shall but prove the gate to heaven.
    Jesus, here I die to Thee,
    There to live eternally.

[4] Let us gladly live with Jesus;
    Since He's risen from the dead,
    Death and grave must soon release us.
    Jesus, Thou art now our Head.
    We are truly Thine own members;
    Where Thou livest, there live we.
    Take and own us constantly,
    Faithful Friend, as Thy dear brethren.
    Jesus, here I live to Thee,
    Also there eternally.
    Amen
