Hymn #237 - Thou to Whom the Sick and Dying
Tune: NAAR MIT OIE
File: elh237.txt

[1] Thou to whom the sick and dying
    Ever came, nor came in vain,
    Still with healing word replying
    To the wearied cry of pain;
    Hear us, Jesus as we meet,
    Suppliants at Thy mercy-seat.

[2] Still the weary, sick, and dying
    Need a brother's, sister's care,
    On Thy higher help relying,
    May we now their burdens share,
    Bringing all our off'rings meet,
    Suppliant to Thy mercy-seat.

[3] May each child of Thine be willing,
    Willing both in hand and heart,
    All the law of love fulfilling,
    Comfort ever to impart,
    Ever bringing off'rings meet,
    Suppliant at Thy mercy-seat.

[4] Then shall sickness, sin, and sadness
    To Thy healing power yield
    Till the sick and sad, in gladness,
    Rescued, ransomed, cleansed, and healed,
    One in Thee together meet,
    Pardoned at Thy judgement-seat.
    Amen
