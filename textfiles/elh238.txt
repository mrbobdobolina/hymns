Tune: HERR JESU CHRIST, WAHR MENSCH
File: elh238.txt

[1] Lord Jesus Christ, true Man and God,
    Who borest anguish, scorn, the rod,
    And diedst at last upon the tree,
    To gain Thy Father's grace for me:

[2] I pray Thee, through that bitter woe,
    Let me, a sinner, mercy know
    When comes the hour of failing breath
    And I must wrestle, Lord, with death.

[3] When from my sight all fades away,
    And when my tongue no more can say,
    And when mine ears no more can hear,
    And when my heart is racked with fear,

[4] When all my mind is darkened o'er,
    And human help can do no more;
    Then come, Lord, Jesus, come with speed,
    And help me in the hour of need.

[5] Lead me from this dark vale beneath,
    And shorten then the pangs of death;
    And evil spirits drive away,
    But let Thy Spirit with me stay,

[6] Until my soul the body leave;
    Then in Thy hands my soul receive,
    And let the earth the body keep,
    Till the last day shall break it sleep.

[7] Joyful my resurrection be,
    Thou in the Judgment plead for me,
    And hide my sins, Lord, from Thy face,
    And give me life, of Thy dear grace!

[8] Implicitly I trust Thee, Lord,
    For Thou hast promised in Thy Word:
    "In truth I tell you, who receives
    My Word, and keeps it, and believes,

[9] Shall never fall God's wrath beneath,
    Shall never taste eternal death;
    Though here he must return to dust,
    He still is noways therefore lost;

[10] For I will with a mighty hand
     Deliver him from death's strong band,
     And lift him hence that he shall be
     Forever in My realm with Me,

[11] Forever living there in bliss."
     O let us not that glory miss!
     Dear Lord, forgive us all our guilt,
     Help us to wait until Thou wilt

[12] That we depart; and let our faith
     Be brave, and conquer e'en in death,
     Firm resting in Thy sacred Word,
     Until we sleep in Thee, our Lord.
     Amen
