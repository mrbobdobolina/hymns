Hymn #239a - I Lay My Sins on Jesus
Tune: HERZLICH TUT MICH VERLANGEN
File: elh239a.txt

[1] I lay my sins on Jesus,
    The spotless Lamb of God;
    He bears them all and frees us
    From the accursed load.
    I bring my guilt to Jesus
    To wash my crimson stains
    While in His blood most precious
    Till not a spot remains.

[2] I lay my wants on Jesus,
    All fullness dwells in Him;
    He healeth my diseases,
    He doth my soul redeem.
    I lay my griefs on Jesus,
    My burdens and my cares;
    He from them all releases,
    He all my sorrows shares.

[3] I rest my soul on Jesus,
    This weary soul of mine;
    His right hand me embraces,
    I on His brest recline.
    I love the name of Jesus,
    "God with us," Christ, the Lord;
    Like fragrance on the breezes
    His name abroad is poured.

[4] I long to be like Jesus,
    Meek, loving, lowly, mild;
    I long to be like Jesus,
    The Father's holy Child.
    I long to be with Jesus
    Amid the heav'nly throng
    To sing with saints His praises,
    To learn the angels' song.
    Amen
