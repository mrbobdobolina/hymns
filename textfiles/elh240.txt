Hymn #240 - Jesus, Refuge of the Weary
Tune: O DU LIEBE MEINER LIEBE
File: elh240.txt

[1] Jesus, Refuge of the weary,
    Blest Redeemer, whom we love,
    Fountain in life's desert dreary,
    Savior from the world above,
    O how oft thine eyes, offended,
    Gazed upon the sinner's fall!
    Yet, upon the cross extended,
    Thou didst bear the pain of all.

[2] Do we pass that cross unheeding,
    Breathing no repentant vow,
    Though we see Thee wounded, bleeding,
    See Thy thorn-encircled brow?
    Yet Thy sinless death hath brought us
    Life eternal, peace, and rest,
    Only what Thy grace has taught us
    Calms the sinner's stormy breast.

[3] Jesus, may our hearts be burning
    With more fervent love for Thee!
    May our eyes be ever turning
    To Thy cross of agony,
    Till in glory, parted never
    From the blessed Savior's side,
    Graven in our hearts forever,
    Dwell the cross, the Crucified!
    Amen
