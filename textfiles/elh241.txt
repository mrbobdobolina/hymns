Hymn #241 - He That Believes and Is Baptized
Tune: ES IST DAS HEIL
File: elh241.txt

[1] He that believes and is baptized
    Shall see the Lord's salvation;
    Baptized into the death of Christ,
    He is a new creation.
    Through Christ's redemption he shall stand
    Among the glorious heav'nly band
    Of ev'ry tribe and nation.

[2] With one accord, O God, we pray:
    Grant us Thy Holy Spirit.
    Look Thou on our infirmity
    Through Jesus' blood and merit.
    Grant us to grow in grace each day
    By holy baptism that we may
    Eternal life inherit!
    Amen
