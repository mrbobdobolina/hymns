Tune: O DASS ICH TAUSEND ZUNGEN HATTE
File: elh242.txt

[1] Baptized into Thy name most holy,
    O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
    I claim a place, though weak and lowly,
    Among Thy seed, Thy chosen host,
    Buried with Christ and dead to sin,
    Thy Spirit now shall live within.

[2] My loving Father, Thou dost take me
    To be henceforth Thy child and heir;
    My faithful Savior, Thou dost make me
    The fruit of all Thy sorrows share
    Thou, Holy Ghost, wilt comfort me
    When darkest clouds around I see.

[3] And I have vowed to fear and love Thee
    And to obey Thee, Lord, alone;
    Because the Holy Ghost did move me,
    I dared to pledge myself Thine own,
    Renouncing sin to keep the faith,
    And war with evil unto death.

[4] My faithful God, Thou failest never,
    Thy cov'nant surely will abide;
    O cast me not away forever
    Should I transgress it on my side.
    Though I have oft my soul defiled,
    Do Thou forgive, restore, Thy child.

[5] Yea, all I am and love most dearly
    I offer now, O Lord, to Thee;
    O let me make my vows sincerely
    And help me Thine own child to be!
    Let naught within me, naught I own
    Serve any will but Thine alone.

[6] Depart, depart, thou prince of darkness!
    No more by thee I'll be enticed.
    Here is indeed a tarnished conscience,
    But sprinkled with the blood of Christ.
    Away, vain world! O sin, away!
    Lo, I renounce you all this day.

[7] And never let my purpose falter,
    O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
    But keep me faithful to Thine altar
    Till Thou shalt call me from my post.
    So unto Thee I live and die
    And praise Thee evermore on high.
    Amen
