Tune: LIEBSTER JESU, WIR SIND HIER
File: elh244.txt

[1] Dearest Jesus, we are here,
    Gladly Thy command obeying;
    With this child we now draw near
    In accord with Thine own saying
    That to Thee it shall be given
    As a child and heir of heaven.

[2] Yea, Thy Word is clear and plain,
    And we would obey it duly:
    "He who is not born again,
    Heart and life renewing truly,
    Born of water and the Spirit,
    Can My kingdom not inherit."

[3] Therefore hasten we to Thee,
    In our arms this infant bearing;
    Let us here Thy glory see,
    Let this child, Thy mercy sharing
    In Thine arms be shielded ever,
    Thine on earth and Thine forever.

[4] Wash it, Jesus, in Thy blood,
    From the sin-stain of its nature;
    Let it rise from out this flood
    Clothed in Thee, a newborn creature;
    May it, washed as Thou hast bidden,
    In Thine innocence be hidden.

[5] Turn its darkness into light,
    To Thy grace receive and save it;
    Heal the serpent's venomed bite
    In the font where now we lave it;
    Here let flow a Jordan river
    And from leprous sin deliver.

[6] Gracious Head, Thy member own;
    Shepherd, take Thy lamb and feed it;
    Prince of Peace, make here Thy throne;
    Way of Life, to heaven lead it;
    Precious Vine, let nothing sever
    From Thy side this branch forever.

[7] Now into Thy heart we pour
    Prayers that from our hearts proceeded.
    Our petitions heav'nward soar;
    May our warm desires be heeded!
    Write the name we now have given,
    Write it in the book of heaven.
    Amen
