Hymn #245 - At Jesus' Feet Our Infant Sweet
Tune: ELLACOMBE
File: elh245.txt

[1] At Jesus' feet our infant sweet
    We lay with all sin's stain,
    That renders him for heav'n unmeet
    Until he's born again.
    We here embrace God's mighty grace
    In this baptismal wave,
    Nor shall the world our trust efface--
    For "Baptism now doth save."

[2] We cannot see the Holy Three
    Concealed the font within,
    Mere water seems the mystery
    That cleanses us from sin;
    But everlasting gifts now dwell
    Through God's Word in this flood;
    Faith speaks, through reason may rebel:
    "This flood is Jesus' blood!"
    Amen
