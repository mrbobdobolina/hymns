Hymn #248 - Now Christ, the Sinless Son of God
Tune: DEUS TUORUM MILITUM
File: elh248.txt

[1] Now Christ, the sinless Son of God,
    On sinners sends this saving flood;
    This is the water which the Lord
    Has joined unto His saving Word.

[2] This flood, to cleanse sin's leprosy,
    Mere earthly water cannot be;
    Here water and God's gracious Word
    Are joined; Salvation they afford!

[3] "Go forth," says Christ, "My Word proclaim,
    Baptize all nations in God's name;
    All who are baptized and believe
    Life everlasting shall receive."

[4] God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
    To be baptized invites a host;
    Here He is present, though unseen,
    From all our sins He's washed us clean.

[5] And so by our repentance, must
    To old man, with his sins and lust,
    Be daily drowned and then arise
    God's own child, righteous, pure, and wise.

[6] Since by this water and the Word
    We're born again, we thank You, Lord.
    Through life and death Yours may we be,
    Your children through eternity.
    Amen
