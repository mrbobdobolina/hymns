Hymn #249 - Fight the Good Fight
Tune: MENDON
File: elh249.txt

[1] Fight the good fight with all your might;
    Christ is your strength, and Christ your right.
    Lay hold on life, and it shall be
    Your joy and crown eternally.

[2] Run the straight race through God's good grace;
    Lift up your eyes, and seek His face.
    Life with its way before us lies;
    Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.

[3] Cast care aside, lean on your guide;
    His boundless mercy will provide.
    Trust, and enduring faith shall prove
    Christ is your life, and Christ your love.

[4] Faint not nor fear, His arms are near;
    He changes not who holds you dear;
    Only believe, and you will see
    That Christ is all eternally.
    Amen
