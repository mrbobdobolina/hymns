Hymn #250 - A Mighty Fortress Is Our God
Tune: EIN FESTE BURG
File: elh250.txt

[1] A mighty Fortress is our God,
    A trusty Shield and Weapon;
    He helps us free from ev'ry need
    That hath us now o'ertaken.
    The old evil Foe
    Now means deadly woe;
    Deep guile and great might
    Are his dread arms in fight;
    On earth is not his equal.

[2] With might of ours can naught be done,
    Soon were our loss effected;
    But for us fights the Valiant One,
    Whom God Himself elected.
    Ask ye, Who is this?
    Jesus Christ it is,
    Of Sabaoth Lord,
    And there's none other God;
    He holds the field forever.

[3] Though devils all the world should fill,
    All eager to devour us,
    We tremble not, we fear no ill,
    They shall not overpow'r us.
    This world's prince may still
    Scowl fierce as he will,
    He can harm us none,
    He's judged; the deed is done;
    One little word can fell him.

[4] The Word they still shall let remain
    Nor any thanks have for it;
    He's by our side upon the plain
    With His good gifts and Spirit.
    And take they our life,
    Goods, fame, child, and wife,
    Let these all be gone,
    They yet have nothing won;
    The Kingdom ours remaineth.
    Amen
