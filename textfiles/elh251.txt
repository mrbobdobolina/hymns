Hymn #251 - A Mighty Fortress Is Our God
Tune: EIN FESTE BURG
File: elh251.txt

[1] A mighty Fortress is our God,
    A trusty Shield and Weapon;
    Our help is He in all our need,
    Our stay whate'er doth happen;
    For still our ancient foe
    Doth seek to work us woe;
    Strong mail of craft and pow'r
    He weareth in this hour;
    On earth is not his equal.

[2] Stood we alone in our own might,
    Our striving would be losing;
    For us the one true Man doth fight,
    The Man of God's own choosing.
    Who is this chosen One?
    'Tis Jesus Christ, the Son,
    The Lord of host, 'tis He
    Who wins the victory
    In ev'ry field of battle.

[3] And were the world with devils filled,
    All watching to devour us,
    Our souls to fear we need not yield,
    They cannot overpow'r us.
    Their dreaded prince no more
    Can harm us as of yore;
    His rage we can endure;
    For lo! his doom is sure,
    A word shall overthrow him.

[4] Still must they leave God's Word its might,
    For which no thanks they merit;
    Still is He with us in the fight,
    With His good gifts and Spirit.
    And should they, in the strife,
    Take kindred, goods, and life.
    We freely let them go,
    They profit not the foe;
    With us remains the kingdom.
    Amen
