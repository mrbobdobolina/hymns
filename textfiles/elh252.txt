Hymn #252 - I Walk in Danger All the Way
Tune: DER LIEBEN SONNE LICHT UND PRACHT
File: elh252.txt

[1] I walk in danger all the way;
    The thought shall never leave me
    That Satan, who has marked his prey,
    Is plotting to deceive me.
    This foe with hidden snares
    May seize me unawares
    If e'er I fail to watch and pray;
    I walk in danger all the way.

[2] I pass through trials all the way,
    With sin and ills contending;
    In patience I must bear each day
    The cross of God's own sending.
    Oft in adversity
    I know not where to flee,
    When storms of woe my soul dismay;
    I pass through trials all the way.

[3] Death doth pursue me all the way;
    Nowhere I rest securely.
    He comes by night, he comes by day,
    And takes his prey most surely.
    A failing breath, and I
    In death's strong grasp may lie
    To face eternity for aye.
    Death doth pursue me all the way.

[4] I walk with angels all the way;
    They shield me and befriend me.
    All Satan's pow'r is held at bay
    When heav'nly hosts attend me.
    They are my sure defense,
    All fear and sorrow, hence!
    Unharmed by foes, do what they may,
    I walk with angels all the way.

[5] I walk with Jesus all the way;
    His guidance never fails me.
    Within His wounds I find a stay
    When Satan's pow'r assails me,
    And, by His footsteps led,
    My path I safely tread.
    In spite of ills that threaten may,
    I walk with Jesus all the way.

[6] My walk is heav'nward all the way;
    Await, my soul, the morrow,
    When thou shalt find release for aye
    From all thy sin and sorrow.
    All worldly pomp, begone!
    To heav'n I now press on.
    For all the world I would not stay;
    My walk is heav'nward all the way.
    Amen
