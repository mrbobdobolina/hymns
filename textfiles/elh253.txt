Hymn #253 - Rise, My Soul, to Watch and Pray
Tune: STRAF MICH NICHT
File: elh253.txt

[1] Rise, my soul, to watch and pray;
    From thy sleep awaken!
    Be not by the evil day
    Unawares o'ertaken.
    For the foe, Well we know,
    Oft his harvest reapeth
    While the Christian sleepeth.

[2] Watch against the devil's snares
    Lest asleep he find thee;
    For indeed no pains he spares
    To deceive and blind thee.
    Satan's prey Oft are they
    Who secure are sleeping
    And no watch are keeping.

[3] Watch! Let not the wicked world
    With its pow'r defeat thee.
    Watch lest with her pomp unfurled
    She betray and cheat thee.
    Watch and see Lest there be
    Faithless friends to charm thee
    Who but seek to harm thee.

[4] Watch against yourself, my soul,
    Lest with grace thou trifle;
    Let not self thy thoughts control
    Nor God's mercy stifle.
    Pride and sin Lurk within,
    All thy hopes to scatter;
    Heed not when they flatter.

[5] But while watching, also pray
    To the Lord unceasing.
    He will free thee, by thy Stay,
    Strength and faith increasing.
    O Lord, bless In distress
    And let nothing swerve me
    From the will to serve Thee.

[6] Therefore let us watch and pray,
    Knowing He will hear us
    As we see from day to day
    Dangers ever near us,
    And the end Doth impend--
    Our redemption neareth
    When the Lord appeareth.
    Amen
