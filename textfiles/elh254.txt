Hymn #254 - In Vain Would Boasting Reason Find
Tune: HERRNHUT
File: elh254.txt

[1] In vain would boasting reason find
    The path to happiness and God;
    Her weak directions leave the mind
    Bewildered in a doubtful road.

[2] Jesus, Thy words alone impart
    Eternal life, on these I live;
    Here sweeter comforts cheer my heart
    Than all the pow'rs of nature give.

[3] Here let my constant feet abide;
    Thou art the true, the living Way.
    Let Thy good Spirit by my guide
    To the bright realms of endless day.

[4] The various forms that men devise
    To shake my faith with treach'rous art
    I scorn as vanity and lies
    And bind Thy Gospel to my heart.
    Amen
