Hymn #256 - When Afflictions Sore Oppress You
Tune: FREU DICH SEHR
File: elh256.txt

[1] When afflictions sore oppress you,
    Low with grief and anguish bowed,
    Then to earnest prayer address you;
    Prayer will help you, through the cloud,
    Still to see your Savior near,
    Under ev'ry cross you bear;
    By the light His Word doth lend you,
    Prayer will joy and comfort send you.

[2] None shall ever be confounded,
    Who in God will freely trust;
    Though they be by woes surrounded,
    God's a Rock to all the just.
    Though you deem He hears you not,
    Still your wants are ne'er forgot;
    Cry to Him when storms assail you,
    Let your courage never fail you.

[3] Call on God, knock, seek, implore Him,
    'Tis the Christian's noblest skill;
    He who comes with faith before Him
    Meets with help and favor still:
    Who on God most firmly rest
    Are the wisest and the best;
    God will with such strength imbue them,
    Ne'er shall any foe subdue them.

[4] Learn to mark God's wondrous dealing
    With the people that He loves;
    When His chast'ning hand they're feeling,
    Then their faith the strongest proves.
    God is nigh, and notes their tears,
    Though He answers not, He hears;
    Pray with faith, for though He try you,
    No good things can God deny you.

[5] Ponder all God's truth can teach you,
    Let His word your footsteps guide;
    Satan's wiles shall never reach you,
    Though he draw the world aside.
    Lo! God's truth is thy defense,
    Light, and hope, and confidence:
    Trust in God, He'll not deceive you,
    Pray, and all your foes will leave you.
    Amen
