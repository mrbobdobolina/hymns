Hymn #257 - When in the Hour of Utmost Need
Tune: WENN WIR IN HOCHSTEN NOTEN SEIN
File: elh257.txt

[1] When in the hour of utmost need
    We know not where to look for aid;
    When days and nights of anxious thought
    Nor help nor counsel yet have brought,

[2] Then this our comfort is alone:
    That we may meet before Thy throne
    And cry, O faithful God, to Thee
    For rescue from our misery;

[3] To Thee may raise our hearts and eyes,
    Repenting sore with bitter sighs,
    And seek Thy pardon for our sin
    And respite from our griefs within.

[4] For Thou hast promised graciously
    To hear all those who cry to Thee
    Through Him whose name alone is great,
    Our Savior and our Advocate.

[5] And thus we come, O God, today
    And all our woes before Thee lay;
    For sorely tried, cast down, we stand,
    Perplexed by fears on ev'ry hand.

[6] Ah! hide not for our sins Thy face,
    Absolve us through Thy boundless grace;
    Be with us in our anguish still;
    Free us at last from ev'ry ill

[7] That so with all our hearts we may
    To Thee our glad thanksgiving pay,
    Then walk obedient to Thy Word,
    And now and ever praise Thee, Lord.
    Amen
