Tune: HERRE JESU KRIST
File: elh258.txt

[1] Lord Jesus Christ, My Savior blest,
    My Hope and my Salvation!
    I trust in Thee;
    Deliver me
    From misery;
    Thy Word's my consolation.

[2] As Thou dost will, Lead Thou me still
    That I may truly serve Thee.
    My God, I pray,
    Teach me Thy way,
    To my last day
    In Thy true faith preserve me.

[3] Most heartily I trust in Thee;
    Thy mercy fails me never.
    Dear Lord, abide;
    My Helper tried,
    Thou Crucified,
    From evil keep me ever.

[4] Now henceforth must I put my trust
    In Thee, O dearest Savior.
    Thy comfort choice,
    Thy Word and voice,
    My heart rejoice
    Despite my ill behavior.

[5] When sorrows, rise, My refuge lies
    In Thy compassion tender.
    Within Thine arm
    Can naught alarm;
    Keep me from harm,
    Be Thou my strong Defender.

[6] I have Thy Word, Christ Jesus, Lord;
    Thou never wilt forsake me.
    This will I plead
    In time of need.
    O help with speed,
    When troubles overtake me!

[7] Grant, Lord, I pray, Thy grace each day
    That we, Thy Law revering,
    May live with Thee,
    And happy be
    Eternally,
    Before Thy throne appearing.
    Amen
