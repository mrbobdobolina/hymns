Hymn #259 - The Kingdom Satan Founded
Tune: AUS MEINES HERZENS GRUNDE
File: elh259.txt

[1] The kingdom Satan founded
    Shall now be overthrown,
    For Christ its fall hath sounded,
    And though His pow'r alone
    Shall Satan meet his doom,
    And be for aye confounded;
    He from the souls he wounded
    Shall flee in fear and gloom.

[2] Though he would bind forever
    Our lips with bands of hell,
    Yet Christ, sent to deliver,
    Can loose those bands full well,
    That e'en the dumb may raise
    His voice with joy and pleasure
    And sing in sweetest measure
    To God his thanks and praise.

[3] O Jesus! my distresses
    To Thee are known full well,
    Thou seest how Satan presses
    My soul's weak citadel;
    His aim is to control
    My members and my senses,
    With sin and with offenses
    He steals into my soul.

[4] Anon my tongue he bindeth
    That God it shall not praise;
    Anon my eyes he blindeth
    To hide the light of grace;
    Now he my ears doth close
    To hinder me from hearing
    The Gospel's sound so cheering
    And soothing in my woes.

[5] To God I raise my crying
    Before the mercy-seat,
    And on His Word relying
    I grace of Him entreat,
    That He for Jesus' sake
    Would cleanse my soul and spirit
    Through Jesus' blood and merit,
    And Satan's power break.

[6] God, let not love of sinning
    Thy fear drive from my breast,
    Lest Satan, triumph winning,
    Be of my heart possessed;
    O let Thy chast'ning rod
    Each day give me direction,
    To seek Thy sure protection
    And tell Thy grace abroad.

[7] My heart must Thou have solely,
    My Savior and my God!
    Come, Jesus, take it wholly,
    And make it Thine abode!
    Mold it to Thy control,
    That I, Thy Word receiving,
    May find, in Thee believing,
    Salvation for my soul.
    Amen
