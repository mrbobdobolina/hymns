Hymn #260 - Now Let Triumphant Faith Dispel
Tune: AZMON
File: elh260.txt

[1] Now let triumphant faith dispel
    Our fears of guilt and woe!
    If God be for us--God the Lord--
    Who dares to be our foe?

[2] He who His only Son gave up
    To death, that we might live,
    Shall He not all things freely grant
    His boundless love can give?

[3] Who now His people shall accuse?
    For God has justified!
    Who now His people shall condemn?
    The Lamb of God has died!

[4] And He who died has ris'n again
    Triumphant from the grave;
    At God's right hand for us He pleads,
    Eternally to save.
    Amen
