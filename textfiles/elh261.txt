Hymn #261 - Who Trusts in God, a Strong Abode
Tune: WAS MEIN GOTT WILL
File: elh261.txt

[1] Who trusts in God, a strong abode
    In heav'n and earth possesses;
    Who looks in love To Christ above,
    No fear his heart oppresses.
    In Thee alone, dear Lord, we own
    Sweet hope and consolation,
    Our Shield from foes, our Balm for woes,
    Our great and sure Salvation.

[2] Though Satan's wrath beset our path
    And worldly scorn assail us,
    While Thou art near, we will not fear;
    Thy strength will never fail us.
    Thy rod and staff shall keep us safe
    And guide our steps forever;
    Nor shades of death nor hell beneath
    Our souls from The will sever.

[3] In all the strife of mortal life
    Our feet will stand securely;
    Temptation's hour shall lose its pow'r,
    For Thou shalt guard us surely.
    O God, renew with heav'nly dew
    Our body, soul, and spirit
    Until we stand at Thy right hand
    Through Jesus' saving merit.
    Amen
