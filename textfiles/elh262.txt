Hymn #262 - Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah
Tune: CWM RHONDDA
File: elh262.txt

[1] Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
    Pilgrim through this barren land.
    I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
    Hold me with Thy pow'rful hand.
    Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven,
    Feed me till I want no more,
    Feed me till I want no more.

[2] Open now the crystal fountain
    Whence the healing stream doth flow;
    Let the fire and cloudy pillar
    Lead me all my journey through.
    Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer,
    Be Thou still my Strength and Shield,
    Be Thou still my Strength and Shield.

[3] When I tread the verge of Jordan,
    Bid my anxious fears subside;
    Death of death, and hell's destruction,
    Land me safe on Canaan's side.
    Songs of praises, songs of praises
    I will ever give to Thee,
    I will ever give to Thee.
    Amen
