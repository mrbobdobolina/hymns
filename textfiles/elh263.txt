Hymn #263 - Jesus, Priceless Treasure
Tune: JESU, MEINE FREUDE
File: elh263.txt

[1] Jesus, priceless Treasure,
    Fount of purest pleasure,
    Truest Friend to me.
    Ah, how long in anguish
    Shall my spirit languish,
    Yearning, Lord, for Thee?
    Thou art mine, O Lamb divine!
    I will suffer naught to hide Thee,
    Naught I ask beside Thee.

[2] In Thine arms I rest me;
    Foes who would molest me
    Cannot reach me here.
    Though the earth be shaking,
    Ev'ry heart be quaking,
    Jesus calms my fear.
    Lightnings flash And thunders crash;
    Yet, though sin and hell assail me,
    Jesus will not fail me.

[3] Satan, I defy thee;
    Death, I now decry thee;
    Fear, I bid thee cease.
    World, thou shalt not harm me
    Nor thy threats alarm me
    While I sing of peace.
    God's great pow'r Guards ev'ry hour;
    Earth and all its depth adore Him,
    Silent bow before Him.

[4] Hence, all earthly treasure!
    Jesus is my Pleasure,
    Jesus is my Choice.
    Hence, all empty glory!
    Naught to me thy story
    Told with tempting voice.
    Pain or loss, Or shame or cross
    Shall not from my Savior move me
    Since He deigns to love me.

[5] Evil world, I leave thee;
    Thou canst not deceive me,
    Thine appeal is vain.
    Sin that once did blind me,
    Get thee far behind me,
    Come not forth again.
    Past thy hour, O pride and pow'r;
    Sinful life, thy bonds I sever,
    Leave thee now forever.

[6] Hence, all fear and sadness!
    For the Lord of gladness,
    Jesus, enters in.
    Those who love the Father,
    Though the storms may gather,
    Still have peace within.
    Yea, whate'er I here must bear,
    Thou art still my purest Pleasure,
    Jesus, priceless Treasure!
    Amen
