Tune: GUD SKAL ALTING MAGE
File: elh264.txt

[1] Jesus, priceless Treasure,
    Source of purest pleasure,
    Truest friend to me.
    Ah, how long I've panted,
    And my heart hath fainted,
    Thirsting, Lord, for Thee!
    Thine I am, O spotless Lamb!
    I will suffer naught to hide Thee,
    Naught I ask beside Thee.

[2] In Thine arm I rest me;
    Foes who would molest me
    Cannot reach me here.
    Though the earth be shaking,
    Ev'ry heart be quaking,
    Jesus calms my fear.
    Fires may flash And thunder crash;
    Yea, and sin and hell assail me,
    Jesus will not fail me.

[3] Hence, with earthly treasure!
    Thou art all my Pleasure,
    Jesus, all my Choice.
    Hence, thou empty glory!
    Naught to me thy story
    Told with tempting voice.
    Pain or loss Or same or cross
    Shall not from my Savior move me
    Since He deigns to love me.

[4] Fare thee well that errest,
    Thou that earth preferrest,
    Thou wilt tempt in vain.
    Fare thee well, transgression,
    Hence, abhorred possession,
    Come not forth again.
    Past your hour, O pride and pow'r,
    Worldly life, thy bond I sever,
    Fare thee well forever!

[5] Hence, all fear and sadness!
    For the Lord of gladness,
    Jesus, enters in.
    Those who love the Father,
    Though the storms may gather,
    Still have peace within.
    Yea, whate'er I here must bear,
    Thou art still my purest Pleasure,
    Jesus, priceless Treasure.
    Amen
