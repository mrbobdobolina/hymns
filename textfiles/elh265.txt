Hymn #265 - Wide Open Are Thy Hands
Tune: ABER
File: elh265.txt

[1] Wide open are Thy hands,
    Paying with more than gold
    The awful debt of guilty men,
    Forever and of old.

[2] Ah, let me grasp those hands,
    That we may never part,
    And let the power of their blood
    Sustain my fainting heart.

[3] Wide open are thine arms,
    A fallen world to embrace;
    To take to love and endless rest
    Our whole forsaken race.

[4] Lord, I am sad and poor,
    But boundless is Thy grace;
    Give me the soul transforming joy
    For which I seek Thy face.

[5] Draw all my mind and heart
    Up to Thy throne on high,
    And let Thy sacred Cross exalt
    My spirit to the sky.

[6] To these, Thy mighty hands,
    My spirit I resign;
    Living, I live alone to Thee,
    And, dying, I am Thine.
    Amen
