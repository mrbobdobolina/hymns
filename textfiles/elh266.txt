Tune: O WELT, ICH MUSS DICH LASSEN
File: elh266.txt

[1] O Bread of life from heaven,
    To weary pilgrims given,
    O Manna from above:
    The souls that hunger feed Thou,
    The hearts that seek Thee lead Thou,
    With Thy most sweet and tender love.

[2] O Fount of grace redeeming,
    O River ever streaming
    From Jesus' holy side:
    Come Thou, Thyself bestowing
    On thirsting souls, and flowing
    Till all their wants are satisfied.

[3] Jesus, this feast receiving,
    Thy Word of truth believing,
    We Thee unseen adore:
    Grant, when our race is ended,
    That we, to heav'n ascended,
    May see Thy glory ever more.
    Amen
