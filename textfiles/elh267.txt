Hymn #267 - From East to West
Tune: CHRISTUM WIR SOLLEN LOBEN SCHON
File: elh267.txt

[1] From east to west, from shore to shore,
    Let ev'ry heart awake and sing
    The Holy Child whom Mary bore,
    The Christ, the everlasting King.

[2] Behold, the world's Creator wears
    The form and fashion of our frame;
    Our very flesh our Maker shares,
    To save a fallen world He came.

[3] For this how wondrously He wrought!
    A maiden, in her lowly place,
    Became, in ways beyond all thought,
    The chosen vessel of His grace.

[4] She bowed her to the angel's word,
    Declaring what the Father willed,
    And suddenly the promised Lord
    That pure and hallowed temple filled.

[5] He shrank not from the oxen's stall,
    He lay within the manger bed,
    And He whose bounty feedeth all
    At Mary's breast Himself was fed.

[6] And while the angels in the sky
    Sang praise above the silent field,
    To shepherds poor the Lord most high,
    The one great Shepherd, was revealed.

[7] All glory for this blessed morn
    To God the Father ever be;
    All praise to Thee, O Virgin-born,
    All praise, O Holy Ghost, to Thee.
    Amen
