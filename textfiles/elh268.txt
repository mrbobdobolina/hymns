Tune: MARIA, HUN ER EN JOMFRU REEN
File: elh268.txt

[1] On Mary, Virgin undefiled,
    Did God bestow His favor;
    She bore a Son, the spotless Child,
    To Him be praise forever!
    He hath us all from sin set free;
    Our stay be He,
    And rest eternal give us!

[2] Were all the sages here below
    All human wisdom showing,
    The mystery of Christ to know
    Were far beyond their knowing;
    For full of grace and truth is He;
    O may He be
    Our comfort in our dying!

[3] Inspired of God the prophets spake,
    And faithful proved their saying,
    That Christ the bonds of sin doth break,
    Deliverance conveying
    To all by Satan's wiles enslaved;
    All shall be saved
    Who trust in Him, believing.

[4] O Root of Jesse, David's Son,
    And Jacob's Star of heaven!
    Thou art the Christ, the blessed One;
    Thy name all praise be given:
    By grace Thou hast redeemed us all
    From Adam's fall,
    And Thou wilt guide and tend us.

[5] O could I speak in ev'ry tongue,
    The Scripture's deep expounding,
    Were in my mouth the angel's song
    That through high heav'n is sounding,
    I on my knees would humbly fall,
    On Jesus call,
    And worship Him forever!

[6] My sins are countless as the sands,
    My crimes, O God, are crying,
    Deliver me from sin's dread bands
    And save me, Lord, when dying;
    O let me not, for evil past,
    Be lost at last,
    Grant me Thy grace, I pray Thee!
    Amen
