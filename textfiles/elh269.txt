Hymn #269 - True God and Yet a Man
Tune: DIVINE PARADOX
File: elh269.txt

[1] True God and yet a Man?
    True maid and yet a mother?
    Thought wonders how thought can
    Conceive one or the other.

[2] A God and can He die?
    A dead Man, can He live?
    What can thought well reply?
    What reason reason give?

[3] God, truth itself does teach;
    Our thoughts sink too far under
    For reason's pow'r to reach.
    Believe and leave to wonder!
    Amen
