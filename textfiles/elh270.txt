Tune: IN BABILONE
File: elh270.txt

[1] Hail, Thou once despised Jesus!
    Hail, Thou Galilean King!
    Thou didst suffered to release us,
    Thou didst free salvation bring.
    Hail, Thou universal Savior,
    Who hast borne our sin and shame;
    By whose merits we find favor;
    Life is given through Thy name.

[2] Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,
    All our sins on Thee were laid;
    By almighty love anointed,
    Thou hast full atonement made.
    Ev'ry sin may be forgiven
    Through the virtue of Thy blood;
    Open is the gate of heaven;
    Peace is made 'twixt man and God.

[3] Jesus, hail, enthroned in glory,
    There forever to abide!
    All the heav'nly hosts adore Thee,
    Seated at Thy Father's side.
    There for sinners Thou art pleading,
    There Thou dost our place prepare,
    Ever for us interceding
    Till in glory we appear.

[4] Worship, honor, pow'r, and blessing
    Thou art worthy to receive;
    Loudest praises, without ceasing,
    Meet it is for us to give.
    Help, ye bright angelic spirits,
    Bring your sweetest, noblest lays;
    Help to sing our Savior's merits;
    Help to chant Immanuel's praise.
    Amen
