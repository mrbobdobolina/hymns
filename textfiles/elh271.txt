Hymn #271 - O Jesus, Lamb of God, Thou Art
Tune: ACH BLEIB BEI UNS
File: elh271.txt

[1] O Jesus Lamb of God, Thou art
    The Life and Comfort of my heart.
    A sinner poor I come to Thee
    And bring my many sins with me.

[2] O God, my sin indeed is great;
    I groan beneath the dreadful weight.
    Be merciful to me, I pray;
    Take guilt and punishment away.

[3] Saint John the Baptist points to Thee
    And bids me cast my sin on Thee;
    For Thou hast left Thy throne on high
    To suffer for the world and die.

[4] Help me to mend my ways, O Lord,
    And gladly to obey Thy Word.
    While here I live, abide with me;
    And when I die, take me to Thee.
    Amen
