Hymn #273 - The Royal Banners Forward Go
Tune: VEXILLA REGIS
File: elh273.txt

[1] The royal banners forward go;
    The cross shines forth in mystic glow
    Where He in flesh, our flesh who made,
    Our sentence bore, our ransom paid;

[2] Where deep for us the spear was dyed,
    Life's torrent rushing from His side,
    To wash us in that precious flood
    Where mingled water and the blood.

[3] Fulfilled is all that David told
    In true prophetic song of old;
    Amidst the nations, God, saith he,
    Hath reigned and triumphed from the Tree.

[4] O Tree of beauty, Tree of life,
    O Tree with fruit of comfort rife;
    Elect, on whose triumphal breast
    Those holy limbs should find their rest;

[5] On whose dear arms, so widely flung,
    The weight of this world's ransom hung
    The price of humankind to pay
    And spoil the spoiler of his prey.

[6] O Cross, our one reliance, hail!
    So may thy pow'r with us avail
    To give new virtue to the saint
    And pardon to the penitent.

[7] To you, eternal Three in One,
    Let homage meet by all be done,
    Whom by the cross Thou dost restore;
    Preserve and govern evermore.
    Amen
