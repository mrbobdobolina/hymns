Tune: NUN KOMM DER HEIDEN HEILAND
File: elh274.txt

[1] When our heads are bowed with woe,
    When our bitter tears o'erflow,
    When we mourn the lost, the dear;
    Jesus, Son of Mary, hear!

[2] Thou our throbbing flesh hast worn,
    Thou our mortal griefs hast borne,
    Thou hast shed the human tear;
    Jesus, Son of Mary, hear!

[3] When the solemn death-bell tolls
    For our own departing souls,
    When our final doom is near;
    Jesus, Son of Mary, hear!

[4] Thou hast bowed the dying head,
    Thou the blood of life hast shed,
    Thou hast filled a mortal bier;
    Jesus, Son of Mary, hear!

[5] When the heart is sad within
    With the thought of all its sin,
    When the spirit shrinks with fear;
    Jesus, Son of Mary, hear!

[6] Thou the shame, the grief, hast known,
    Though the sins were not Thine own,
    Thou hast deigned their load to bear;
    Jesus, Son of Mary, hear!
    Amen
