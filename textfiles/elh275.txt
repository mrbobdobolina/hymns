Tune: WIR DANKEN DIR, HERR JESU CHRIST
File: elh275.txt

[1] We bless Thee, Jesus Christ our Lord;
    Forever be Thy name adored:
    For Thou, the sinless One, hast died,
    That sinners might be justified.

[2] O very Man, and very God,
    Who hast redeemed us with Thy blood;
    From death eternal set us free,
    And make us one with God in Thee.

[3] From sin and shame defend us still,
    And work in us Thy steadfast will,
    The cross with patience to sustain,
    And bravely bear its utmost pain.

[4] In Thee we trust, in Thee alone;
    For thou forsakest not Thine own;
    To all the meek Thy strength is giv'n,
    Who by Thy cross ascend to heav'n.
    Amen
