Hymn #276 - When O'er My Sins I Sorrow
Tune: HERR CHRIST, DER EINIG GOTTS SOHN
File: elh276.txt

[1] When o'er my sins I sorrow,
    Lord, I will look to Thee
    And hence my comfort borrow
    That Thou wast slain for me.
    Yea, Lord, Thy precious blood was spilt
    For me, O most unworthy,
    To take away my guilt.

[2] O what a marv'lous off'ring!
    Behold, the Master spares
    His servants, and their suff'ring
    And grief for them He bears.
    God stoopeth from His throne on high;
    For me, His guilty creature,
    He deigns as Man to die.

[3] My manifold transgression
    Henceforth can harm me none
    Since Jesus' bloody Passion
    For me God's grace hath won.
    His precious blood my debts hath paid;
    Of hell and all its torments
    I am no more afraid.

[4] Therefore I will forever
    Give glory unto Thee,
    O Jesus, loving Savior,
    For what Thou didst for me.
    I'll spend my breath in songs of thanks
    For Thy sad cry, Thy suff'rings,
    Thy wounds, Thy guiltless death.
    Amen
