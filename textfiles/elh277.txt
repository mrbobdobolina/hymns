File: elh277.txt

[Refrain] All glory, laud, and honor
          To Thee, Redeemer, King,
          To whom the lips of children
          Made sweet hosannas ring.

[1] Thou art the King of Israel,
    Thou David's royal Son,
    Who in the Lord's name comest,
    The King and Blessed One.

[Refrain] All glory, laud, and honor
          To Thee, Redeemer, King,
          To whom the lips of children
          Made sweet hosannas ring.

[2] The company of angels
    Is praising Thee on high,
    And mortal men and all things
    Created make reply.

[Refrain] All glory, laud, and honor
          To Thee, Redeemer, King,
          To whom the lips of children
          Made sweet hosannas ring.

[3] The people of the Hebrews
    With palms before Thee went;
    Our praise and prayer and anthems
    Before Thee we present.

[Refrain] All glory, laud, and honor
          To Thee, Redeemer, King,
          To whom the lips of children
          Made sweet hosannas ring.

[4] To Thee, before Thy Passion,
    They sang their hymns of praise;
    To Thee, now high exalted,
    Our melody we raise.

[Refrain] All glory, laud, and honor
          To Thee, Redeemer, King,
          To whom the lips of children
          Made sweet hosannas ring.

[5] Thou didst accept their praises;
    Accept the prayers we bring,
    Who in all good delightest,
    Thou good and gracious King.
    Amen
