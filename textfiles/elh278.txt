Hymn #278 - O Jesus, King Most Wonderful
Tune: ST. AGNES
File: elh278.txt

[1] O Jesus, King most wonderful,
    Thou Conqueror renowned,
    Thou Sweetness most ineffable,
    In whom all joys are found!

[2] When once Thou visitest the heart,
    Then truth begins to shine,
    Then earthly vanities depart,
    Then kindles love divine.

[3] O Jesus, Light of all below,
    Thou Fount of life and fire,
    Surpassing all the joys we know,
    All that we can desire.

[4] May ev'ry heart confess Thy name,
    And ever Thee adore
    And, seeking Thee, itself inflame
    To seek Thee more and more!

[5] Thee may our tongues forever bless,
    Thee may we love alone,
    And ever in our lives express
    The image of Thine own!
    Amen
