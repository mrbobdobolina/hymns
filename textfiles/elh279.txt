Hymn #279 - Hosanna, Loud Hosanna
Tune: ELLACOMBE
File: elh279.txt

[1] Hosanna, loud hosanna,
    The little children sang;
    Through pillared court and temple
    The lovely anthem rang.
    To Jesus, who had blessed them,
    Close folded to His breast,
    The children sang their praises,
    The simplest and the best.

[2] From Olivet they followed
    Mid an exultant crowd;
    The victor palm branch waving
    And chanting clear and loud.
    The Lord of men and angels
    Rode on in lowly state
    Nor scorned that little children
    Should on His bidding wait.

[3] "Hosanna in the highest!"
    That ancient song we sing,
    For Christ is our Redeemer,
    The Lord of heav'n our King.
    O may we ever praise Him
    With heart and life and voice
    And in His blissful presence
    Eternally rejoice!
    Amen
