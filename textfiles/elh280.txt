Hymn #280 - Ride On, Ride On, in Majesty
Tune: WINCHESTER NEW
File: elh280.txt

[1] Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
    Hark! All the tribes hosanna cry.
    O Savior meek, pursue Thy road,
    With palms and scattered garments strowed.

[2] Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
    In lowly pomp ride on to die.
    O Christ, Thy triumphs now begin
    O'er captive death and conquered sin.

[3] Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
    The angel armies of the sky
    Look down with sad and wond'ring eyes
    To see the approaching Sacrifice.

[4] Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
    Thy last and fiercest strife is nigh;
    The Father on His sapphire throne
    Expects His own anointed Son.

[5] Ride on, ride on, in majesty!
    In lowly pomp ride on to die.
    Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain,
    Then take, O Christ, Thy pow'r and reign.
    Amen
