Hymn #281 - O Love, How Deep
Tune: DEO GRACIAS
File: elh281.txt

[1] O love, how deep, how high, how broad,
    How passing thought the love of God,
    That Christ, the Son of God, should take
    Our mortal form for mortals' sake.

[2] He sent no angel to our race,
    Of higher or of lower place,
    But wore the robe of human frame,
    And to this world Himself he came.

[3] For us baptized, for us He bore
    His holy fast and hungered sore;
    For us temptations sharp He knew;
    For us the temper overthrew.

[4] For us He prayed; for us He taught;
    For us His daily works He wrought;
    By words and signs and actions thus
    Still seeking not Himself but us.

[5] For us to wicked hands betrayed,
    Scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,
    He bore the shameful cross and death;
    For us gave up His dying breath.

[6] For us He rose from death again;
    For us He went on high to reign;
    For us He sent His Spirit here
    To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.

[7] All glory to our Lord and God
    For love so deep, so high, so broad,
    The Trinity whom we adore
    Forever and forevermore.
    Amen
