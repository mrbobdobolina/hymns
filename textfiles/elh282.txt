Hymn #282 - Alas! And Did My Savior Bleed
Tune: NEW BRITAIN
File: elh282.txt

[1] Alas! And did my Savior bleed,
    And did my Sov'reign die;
    Would He devote that sacred head
    For such a worm as I?

[2] Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, Thine,
    And bathed in its own blood,
    While all exposed to wrath divine,
    The glorious Suff'rer stood!

[3] Was it for crimes that I had done
    He groaned up on the tree?
    Amazing pity, grace unknown,
    And love beyond degree!

[4] Well might the sun in darkness hide
    And shut his glories in
    When God, the mighty Maker, died
    For man the creature's sin.

[5] Thus might I hide my blushing face
    While His dear cross appears,
    Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
    And melt mine eyes in tears.

[6] But drops of grief can ne'er repay
    The debt of love I owe;
    Dear, Lord, renew my faith today
    And teach me what to do.
    Amen
