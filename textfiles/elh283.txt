Hymn #283 - Glory Be to Jesus
Tune: WEM IN LEIDENSTAGEN
File: elh283.txt

[1] Glory be to Jesus,
    Who in bitter pains
    Poured for me the lifeblood
    From His sacred veins.

[2] Grace and life eternal
    In that blood I find;
    Blest be His compassion,
    Infinitely kind.

[3] Blest through endless ages
    Be the precious stream
    Which from endless torments
    Did the world redeem.

[4] Abel's blood for vengeance
    Pleaded to the skies;
    But the blood of Jesus
    For our pardon cries.

[5] Oft as earth exulting
    Wafts its praise on high,
    Angel hosts rejoicing
    Make their glad reply.

[6] Lift we, then, our voices,
    Swell the mighty flood;
    Louder still and louder
    Praise the precious blood!
    Amen
