Hymn #284 - Go to Dark Gethsemane
Tune: GETHSEMANE
File: elh284.txt

[1] Go to dark Gethsemane,
    Ye that feel the Tempter's pow'r;
    Your Redeemer's conflict see,
    Watch with Him one bitter hour;
    Turn not from His griefs away;
    Learn of Jesus Christ to pray.

[2] Follow to the judgment hall;
    View the Lord of life arraigned.
    O the wormwood and the gall!
    O the pangs His soul sustained!
    Shun not suff'ring, shame, or loss;
    Learn of Him to bear the cross.

[3] Calv'ry's mournful mountain climb;
    There, adoring at His feet,
    Mark that miracle of time,
    God's own sacrifice complete.
    "It is finished!" hear Him cry;
    Learn of Jesus Christ to die.

[4] Early hasten to the tomb
    Where they laid His breathless clay;
    All is solitude and gloom,
    Who hath taken Him away?
    Christ is ris'n! He meets our eyes.
    Savior, teach us so to rise.
    Amen
