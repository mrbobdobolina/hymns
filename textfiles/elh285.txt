Hymn #285 - Jesus Christ, Our Lord Most Holy
Tune: TESHINIENS
File: elh285.txt

[1] Jesus Christ, our Lord most holy,
    Lamb of God so pure and lowly,
    Blameless, blameless, on the cross art offered,
    Sinless, sinless, for our sins hast suffered.

[2] Weep now, all ye wretched creatures,
    As ye view His gracious features.
    Jesus, Jesus, on the cross is dying,
    Nature, nature, in dark gloom is sighing.

[3] Christ, His last word having spoken,
    Bows His head as life is broken.
    Mournful, mournful, stands His mother weeping,
    Loved ones, loved ones, silent watch are keeping.

[4] The great veil was torn asunder,
    Earth did quake mid roars of thunder,
    Boulders, boulders, into bits were breaking;
    Sainted, sainted, dead from death were waking.

[5] As His side with spear was riven,
    Blood and water forth were given.
    Jesus, Jesus, sinners' only Savior,
    Mercy, mercy, grant to us forever.
    Amen
