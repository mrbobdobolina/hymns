Hymn #286 - Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me
Tune: TOPLADY
File: elh286.txt

[1] Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in Thee;
    Let the water and the blood
    From Thy riven side which flowed
    Be of sin the double cure:
    Cleanse me from its guilt and pow'r.

[2] Not the labors of my hands
    Can fulfil Thy Law's demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears forever flow,
    All for sin could not atone;
    Thou must save, and Thou alone.

[3] Nothing in my hand I bring,
    Simply to Thy cross I cling;
    Naked, come to Thee for dress,
    Helpless, look to Thee for grace.
    Foul, I to the fountain fly--
    Wash me, Savior, or I die!

[4] While I draw this fleeting breath,
    When mine eyelids close in death,
    When I soar to worlds unknown,
    See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in Thee!
    Amen
