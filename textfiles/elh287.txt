Hymn #287 - Jesus, I Will Ponder Now
Tune: JESU KREUZ, LEIDEN UND PEIN
File: elh287.txt

[1] Jesus, I will ponder now
    On Thy holy Passion;
    With Thy Spirit me endow
    For such meditation.
    Grant that I in love and faith
    May the image cherish
    Of Thy suff'ring, pain, and death
    That I may not perish.

[2] Make me see Thy great distress,
    Anguish, and affliction,
    Bonds and stripes and wretchedness
    And Thy crucifixion;
    Make me see how scourge and rod,
    Spear and nails, did wound Thee,
    How for man Thou diest, O God,
    Who with thorns had crowned Thee.

[3] Yet, O Lord, not thus alone
    Make me see Thy Passion,
    But its cause to me make known
    And its termination.
    Ah! I also and my sin
    Wrought Thy deep affliction;
    This indeed the cause hath been
    Of Thy crucifixion.

[4] Grant that I Thy Passion view
    With repentant grieving
    Nor Thee crucify anew
    By unholy living.
    How could I refuse to shun
    Ev'ry sinful pleasure
    Since for me God's only Son
    Suffered without measure?

[5] If my sins give me alarm
    And my conscience grieve me,
    Let Thy cross my fear disarm;
    Peace of conscience give me.
    Grant that I may trust in Thee
    And Thy holy Passion.
    If His Son so loveth me,
    God must have compassion.

[6] Grant that I may willingly
    Bear with Thee my crosses,
    Learning humbleness of Thee,
    Peace mid pain and losses.
    May I give Thee love for love!
    Hear me, O my Savior,
    That I may in heav'n above
    Sing Thy praise forever.
    Amen
