Hymn #288 - Beneath the Cross of Jesus Kneeling
Tune: WER NUR DEN LIEBEN GOTT
File: elh288.txt

[1] Beneath the cross of Jesus kneeling
    Dawns on my soul the endless day;
    There, deeper than all tides of feeling,
    Doth God His boundless grace display;
    Thence flow the mystic healing waves;
    There all my stains the Savior laves.

[2] God wrought for man, His love forth-showing,
    When Moses smote the rock of old;
    And, lo, through Israel's camp on-flowing,
    Broke forth the longed-for flood, and rolled,
    New strength, new joy, new life bestowed,
    On lips that quaffed it, pure and cold.

[3] God wrought for man, mankind redeeming,
    When Christ was pierc'd by Roman spear,
    And, o'er the thirsty world down-streaming,
    Forth gushed a fountain, cool and clear,
    Till souls, those blessed waters near,
    Forgot in joy sin's desert drear.

[4] Beside that well for aye abiding,
    New strength, new joy, new life I gain;
    Within that cleft securely hiding,
    No care can harm, no sorrow stain;
    Here rests the blissful soul serene,
    Here faith the healing draft can glean.

[5] Lord, let my heart, this gift receiving,
    Sing one glad anthem to Thy praise;
    And may the stream, Thy pierc'd heart leaving,
    Refresh and heal me all my days:
    Thus by Thy blood my life restored,
    Eternal thanks to Thee, O Lord.
    Amen
