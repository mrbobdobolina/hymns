Hymn #289 - Join All the Glorious Names
Tune: ST. PETER'S, MANCHESTER
File: elh289.txt

[1] Join all the glorious names
    Of wisdom, love, and pow'r,
    That ever mortals knew,
    That angels ever bore:
    All are too weak to speak His worth,
    Too frail to set my Savior forth!

[2] Great Prophet of my God,
    My tongue would bless Thy name;
    By Thee the joyful news
    Of our salvation came;
    The joyful news of sins forgiv'n,
    Of hell subdued, and peace with heav'n.

[3] Be Thou my Counselor,
    My Pattern and my Guide;
    And through this desert land
    Still keep me by Thy side.
    O let my feet ne'er run astray,
    Nor rove, nor seek the crooked way.

[4] I love my Shepherd's voice,
    His watchful eyes shall keep
    My wand'ring soul among
    The thousands of His sheep:
    He feeds His flock, He calls their names,
    His bosom bears the tender lambs.

[5] Jesus my great High Priest,
    Offered His blood and died;
    My guilty conscience seeks
    No Sacrifice beside.
    His pow'rful blood did once atone;
    And now it pleads before the throne.

[6] My Advocate appears
    For my defense on high,
    The Father bows His ear,
    And lays His anger by.
    Not all that hell or sin can say
    Shall turn His heart, His love away.

[7] Should all the hosts of death
    And pow'rs of hell unknown
    Put their most dreadful forms
    Of rage and mischief on;
    I shall be safe, for Christ displays
    Superior pow'r and guardian-grace.
    Amen
