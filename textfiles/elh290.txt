Hymn #290 - Thy Soul, O Jesus, Hallow Me
Tune: O HEILAND, REISS DIE HIMMEL AUF
File: elh290.txt

[1] Thy soul, O Jesus, hallow me,
    Thy spirit steep me all in Thee,
    Thy body, pierc'd by ruthless steel,
    My wretched soul and body heal.

[2] The water from Thy side that poured,
    For me a cleansing bath afford,
    And all Thy blood, with life divine,
    Revive this weakened heart of mine.

[3] The sweat of death upon Thy face
    Deliver me from death's embrace,
    And all Thy Passion, cross, and pain,
    With strength my feebleness sustain.

[4] O Christ, turn not away from me,
    Receive and hide me all in Thee,
    Within Thy holy wounds enclose,
    And keep me safe from all my foes.

[5] In death's dark hour with me abide
    And place me, Savior, at Thy side,
    Where with Thy saints I shall adore
    And praise Thee, Lord, forevermore.
    Amen
