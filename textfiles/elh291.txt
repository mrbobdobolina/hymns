Tune: HERR JESU CHRIST, MEINS
File: elh291.txt

[1] Lord Jesus Christ, my Life, my Light,
    My Strength by day, my Trust by night,
    On earth I'm but a passing guest
    And sorely by my sins oppressed.

[2] Far off I see my fatherland,
    Where through Thy blood I hope to stand.
    But ere I reach that Paradise
    A weary way before me lies.

[3] My heart sinks at the journey's length,
    My wasted flesh has little strength;
    My soul alone still cries in me:
    "Lord, take me home, take me to Thee!"

[4] O let Thy suff'rings give me pow'r
    To meet the last and darkest hour!
    Thy blood refresh and comfort me;
    Thy bonds and fetters make me free.

[5] The blows and stripes that fell on Thee
    Heal up the wounds of sin in me;
    Thy crown of thorns, Thy foes' made spite,
    Let be my glory and delight.

[6] That thirst and bitter draught of Thine
    Cause me to bear with patience mine;
    Thy piercing cry uphold my soul
    When floods of anguish o'er me roll!

[7] Thy Spirit cry within me still
    When here my lips grow white and chill,
    And help my soul thy heav'n to find
    When these poor eyes grow dark and blind!

[8] Thy dying words let be my light
    When death approaches as dark night;
    Defend me in my dying breath
    When then I bow my head in death.

[9] Thy cross let be my staff in life,
    Thy holy grave my rest from strife;
    The winding sheet that covered Thee,
    O let it be a shroud for me.

[10] Lord, in Thy nail prints let me read
     That Thou to save me hast decreed
     And grant that in Thine opened side
     My troubled soul may ever hide.

[11] Since Thou hast died, the Pure, the Just,
     I take my homeward way in trust.
     The gates of heav'n, Lord, open wide
     When here I may no more abide.

[12] And when the last Great Day shall come
     And Thou, our Judge, shalt speak the doom,
     Let me with joy behold the light
     And set me then upon Thy right.

[13] Renew this wasted flesh of mine
     That like the sun it there may shine
     Among the angels pure and bright,
     Yea, like Thyself in glorious light.

[14] Ah, then shall I most joyful be
     And with the angels sing to Thee
     And with Thy blessed, chosen fold
     Fore'er Thy gracious face behold.
     Amen
