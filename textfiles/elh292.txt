Hymn #292 - O Dearest Jesus
Tune: HERZLIEBSTER JESU
File: elh292.txt

[1] O dearest Jesus, what law hast Thou broken
    That such sharp sentence should on Thee be spoken?
    Of what great crime hast Thou to make confession,--
    What dark transgression?

[2] They crown Thy head with thorns, they smite, they scourge Thee;
    With cruel mockings to the cross they urge Thee;
    They give Thee gall to drink, they still decry Thee;
    They crucify Thee.

[3] Whence come these sorrows, whence this mortal anguish?
    It is my sins for which Thou, Lord, must languish;
    Yea, all the wrath, the woe, Thou dost inherit,
    This I do merit.

[4] What punishment so strange is suffered yonder!
    The Shepherd dies for sheep that loved to wander;
    The Master pays the debt His servants owe Him,
    Who would not know Him.

[5] The sinless Son of God must die in sadness;
    The sinful child of man may live in gladness;
    Man forfeited his life and is acquitted--
    God is committed.

[6] There was no spot in me by sin untainted;
    Sick with sin's poison, all my heart had fainted;
    My heavy guilt to hell had well-nigh brought me,
    Such woe it wrought me.

[7] O wondrous love, whose depth no heart hath sounded,
    That brought Thee here, by foes and thieves surrounded!
    All worldly pleasures, heedless, I was trying
    While Thou wert dying.

[8] O mighty King, no time can dim Thy glory!
    How shall I spread abroad Thy wondrous story?
    How shall I find some worthy gifts to proffer?
    What dare I offer?

[9] For vainly doth our human wisdom ponder--
    Thy woes, Thy mercy, still transcend our wonder.
    O how should I do aught that could delight Thee!
    Can I requite Thee?

[10] Yet unrequited, Lord, I would not leave Thee;
     I will renounce whate'er doth vex or grieve Thee
     And quench with thoughts of Thee and prayers most lowly
     All fires unholy.

[11] But since my strength will nevermore suffice me
     To crucify desires that still entice me,
     To all good deeds, oh, let Thy Spirit win me
     And reign within me!

[12] I'll think upon Thy mercy without ceasing,
     That earth's vain joys to me no more be pleasing;
     To do Thy will shall be my sole endeavor
     Henceforth forever.

[13] Whate'er of earthly good this life may grant me,
     I'll risk for Thee; no shame, no cross, shall daunt me.
     I shall not fear what foes can do to harm me
     Nor death alarm me.

[14] But worthless is my sacrifice, I own it;
     Yet, Lord, for love's sake Thou wilt not disown it;
     Thou wilt accept my gift in Thy great meekness
     Nor shame my weakness.

[15] And when, dear Lord, before Thy throne in heaven
     To me the crown of joy at last is given,
     Where sweetest hymns Thy saints forever raise Thee,
     I, too, shall praise Thee.
     Amen
