Hymn #293 - O What Precious Balm and Healing
Tune: DER AM KREUZ
File: elh293.txt

[1] O what precious balm and healing,
    Jesus, in Thy wounds I find!
    Ev'ry hour that I am feeling
    Pains of body and of mind:
    Should some evil thought rush in,
    And provoke my soul to sin,
    Thoughts of Thy deep wounds from sinning
    Keep me in its first beginning.

[2] Should some lust or sharp temptation
    Prove too strong for flesh and blood,
    Lo! I think upon Thy Passion,
    And the breach is soon made good:
    Or should Satan press me hard,
    Thinking I am off my guard,
    Christ, I say, for me was wounded,
    And the tempter flees confounded.

[3] If the world my heart entices
    On the broad and easy road,
    And doth by its gay devices
    Silence ev'ry thought of God,
    When the heavy load I see
    Which, dear Lord, was laid on Thee,
    I can still each wild emotion,
    Calm and blest in my devotion.

[4] Lord, whate'er may pain or grieve me,
    Thy dear wounds can make me whole;
    When my heart sinks, they revive me,
    Life pours in upon my soul:
    May Thy comfort render sweet
    Ev'ry bitter cup I meet;
    Thou who by Thy death and Passion
    Hast procured my soul's salvation.

[5] Lord, on Thee alone I stay me,
    Safely hide beneath Thy wing;
    Death can neither hurt nor slay me,
    Thy death took away his sting:
    That I may in Thee have part,
    Comfort, strengthen, heal my heart;
    Light, and life, and love bestowing,
    All from Thy free mercy flowing.

[6] Well of life, if Thou art nigh me,
    Springing deep within my heart,
    When the last dread hour shall try me,
    I can feel no inward smart:
    If I hide myself in Thee,
    Nor a foe can injure me;
    He shall overcome who hideth
    In Thy wounds, and there abideth.
    Amen
