(hymn words omitted due to copyright restriction)

[1] Over Kedron Jesus treadeth
    To His passion for us all;
    Ev'ry human eye be weeping,
    Tears of bitter grief let fall!
    Round His spirit flock the foes,
    Place their shafts and bend their bows,
    Aiming at the Savior solely,
    While the world forsakes Him wholly.

[2] David once, with heart afflicted,
    Crossed the Kedron's narrow strand,
    Clouds of gloom and grief about him
    When an exile from his land.
    But, O Jesus, blacker now
    Bends the cloud above Thy brow,
    Hasting to death's dreary portals
    For the shame and sin of mortals.

[3] Enter *** *** ******* garden
    As * ******** ***** space,
    Sorrow **** ****** ** darken,
    Follow **** ** **'** place!
    Come ***, ****, **** *** see
    Enter ***** Gethsemane!
    See *** **** ** ****** shaking
    Hellish ******* *** ** taking.

[4] See how, anguish-struck, He falleth
    Prostrate, and with struggling breath,
    Three times on His God He calleth,
    Praying that the bitter death
    And the cup of doom may go,
    Still He cries, in all His woe:
    "Not My will, but thine, O Father!"
    And the angels round Him gather.

[5] See ***, ** **** **** ** darkness,
    Battling **** *** **** pow'r,
    Agonies ****** ****** Him,
    On *** **** *** ****** show'r;
    All *** ****** ****'** *** wet
    With *** ***** ** ****** sweat,
    From *** ********* ***** distilling--
    World's ********** **** fulfilling.

[6] But, O flow'rs, so sadly watered
    By this pure and precious dew,
    In some blessed hour your blossoms
    'Neith the olive-shadows grew!
    Eden's garden did not bear
    Aught that can with you compare,
    For the blood, thus freely given,
    Makes my soul the heir of heaven.

[7] When as flow'rs themselves I wither,
    When I droop and fade like grass,
    When the life-streams through my pulses
    Dull and ever duller pass,
    When at last they cease to roll
    Then, to cheer my singing soul,
    Grace of Jesus, be Thou given--
    Source of triumph! pledge of heaven!

[8] Daily * ** ****** yearning
    E'er ** ** ** ******'* stream
    And **** ******* ******** turning
    In * *********** theme!
    Daily ** Gethsemane
    With ** ****** * ***** see
    Jesus' ******** *** *** sighing
    For ** **** ** *** *** dying.
    Amen
