Hymn #296 - Savior, When in Dust to Thee
Tune: ABERYSTWYTH
File: elh296.txt

[1] Savior, when in dust to Thee
    Low we bow th' adoring knee;
    When, repentant, to the skies
    Scarce we lift our weeping eyes;
    O, by all Thy pains and woe
    Suffered once for us below,
    Bending from Thy throne on high,
    Hear our penitential cry!

[2] By Thy helpless infant years,
    By Thy life of want and tears,
    By Thy days of deep distress
    In the savage wilderness,
    By the dread, mysterious hour
    Of th' insulting tempter's pow'r,
    Turn, O turn a fav'ring eye;
    Hear our penitential cry!

[3] By Thine hour of dire despair,
    By Thine agony of prayer,
    By the cross, the nail, the thorn,
    Piercing spear, and torturing scorn,
    By the gloom that veiled the skies
    O'er the dreadful sacrifice,
    Listen to our humble sigh;
    Hear our penitential cry!

[4] By Thy deep expiring groan,
    By the sad sepulchral stone,
    By the vault whose dark abode
    Held in vain the rising God,
    O from earth to heav'n restored,
    Mighty, reascended Lord,
    Bending from Thy throne on high,
    Hear our penitential cry!
    Amen
