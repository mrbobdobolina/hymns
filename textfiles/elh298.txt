Hymn #298 - Sing, My Tongue, How Glorious Battle
Tune: PICARDY
File: elh298.txt

[1] Sing, my tongue, how glorious battle
    Glorious victory became;
    And above the cross, His trophy,
    Tell the triumph and the fame,
    Tell how He, the world's Redeemer,
    By His death for us o'ercame.

[2] God in pity saw us fallen,
    Shamed and sunk in misery,
    When we fell on death by tasting
    Fruit of the forbidden tree:
    Then another tree was chosen
    Which the world from death should free.

[3] Thus the scheme of our salvation
    Was of old in order laid,
    That the manifold deceiver's
    Art by art might be outweighed,
    And the lure the foe put forward
    Into means of healing made.

[4] Therefore when th' appointed fullness
    Of the holy time was come,
    He was sent, who maketh all things,
    Forth from God's eternal home;
    Thus He came to earth incarnate,
    Offspring of a Virgin's womb.

[5] Thirty years among us dwelling,
    His appointed time fulfilled,
    Born for this, He meets His Passion,
    For that this He freely willed,
    On the cross the Lamb is lifted
    Where His life-blood shall be spilled.

[6] Faithful cross! Above all other,
    One and only noble tree!
    None in foliage, none in blossom,
    None in fruit thy peer may be!
    Sweetest wood and sweetest iron!
    Sweetest weight is hung on thee.

[7] Thou alone wast counted worthy
    This world's ransom to uphold;
    For a shipwrecked race preparing
    Harbor, like the ark of old;
    With the sacred blood anointed
    From the smitten Lamb that rolled.

[8] To the Trinity be glory
    Everlasting, as is meet;
    Equal to the Father, equal
    To the Son and Paraclete:
    O Thou Three in One, whose praises
    All created things repeat.
    Amen
