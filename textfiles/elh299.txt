Hymn #299 - Nature with Open Volume Stands
Tune: O JESU CHRISTE, WAHRES LICHT
File: elh299.txt

[1] Nature with open volume stands
    To spread her Maker's praise abroad
    And ev'ry labor of His hands
    Shows something worthy of our God.

[2] But in the grace that rescued man
    His brightest form of glory shines;
    Here on the Cross 'tis fairest drawn
    In precious blood and crimson lines.

[3] Here His whole name appears complete
    Nor wit can guess, nor reason prove
    Which of the letters is best writ,
    The Pow'r, the Wisdom, or the Love.

[4] Here I behold His inmost heart
    Where grace and vengeance strangely join,
    Here on the Cross 'tis fairest drawn
    In precious blood and crimson lines.

[5] O the sweet wonders of the Cross
    Where God the Savior loved and died!
    Her noblest life my spirit draws
    From His dear wounds and bleeding side.

[6] I would forever speak His name
    In sounds to mortal ears unknown,
    With angels join to praise the Lamb
    And worship at His Father's throne.
    Amen
