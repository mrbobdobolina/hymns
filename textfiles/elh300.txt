Hymn #300 - Sweet the Moments, Rich in Blessing
Tune: BROCKLESBURY
File: elh300.txt

[1] Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
    Which before the cross we spend.
    Life and health and peace possessing
    From the sinners' dying Friend.

[2] Here we rest in wonder, viewing
    All our sins on Jesus laid;
    Here we see redemption flowing
    From the sacrifice He made.

[3] Here we find the dawn of heaven
    While upon the cross we gaze,
    See our trespasses forgiven,
    And our songs of triumph raise.

[4] O that, near the cross abiding,
    We may to the Savior cleave,
    Naught with Him our hearts dividing,
    All for Him content to leave!

[5] Lord, in loving contemplation
    Fix our hearts and eyes on Thee
    Till we taste Thy full salvation
    And Thine unveiled glory see.
    Amen
