Hymn #301 - There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood
Tune: HORSLEY
File: elh301.txt

[1] There is a fountain filled with blood
    Drawn from Immanuel's veins,
    And sinners plunged beneath that flood
    Lose all their guilty stains.

[2] The dying thief rejoiced to see
    That fountain in his day;
    And there have I, as vile as he,
    Washed all my sins away.

[3] Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
    Shall never lose its pow'r
    Till all the ransomed Church of God
    Be saved to sin no more.

[4] E'er since by faith I saw the stream
    Thy flowing wounds supply,
    Redeeming love has been my theme
    And shall be till I die.

[5] When this poor lisping, stamm'ring tongue
    Lies silent in the grave,
    Then in a nobler, sweeter song
    I'll sing Thy pow'r to save.
    Amen
