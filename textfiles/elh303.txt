Hymn #303 - My Song Is Love Unknown
Tune: LOVE UNKNOWN
File: elh303.txt

[1] My song is love unknown,
    My Savior's love to me,
    Love to the loveless shown
    That they might lovely be.
    O who am I That for my sake
    My Lord should take frail flesh and die?

[2] He came from His blest throne
    Salvation to bestow;
    But men made strange, and none
    The longed-for Christ would know.
    But, O my friend, My friend indeed,
    Who at my need His life did spend!

[3] In life no house, no home
    My Lord on earth might have;
    In death no friendly tomb
    But what a stranger gave.
    What may I say? Heav'n was His home;
    But mine the tomb wherein He lay.

[4] Here might I stay and sing;
    No story so divine,
    Never was love, dear King,
    Never was grief like Thine.
    This is my friend, In whose sweet praise
    I all my days could gladly spend.
    Amen
