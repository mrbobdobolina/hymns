Hymn #305 - Not All the Blood of Beasts
Tune: SOUTHWELL
File: elh305.txt

[1] Not all the blood of beasts
    On ancient altars slain
    Could give the guilty conscience peace
    Or wash away the stain.

[2] But Christ, the heav'nly Lamb,
    Takes all our sins away;
    A sacrifice of nobler name
    And richer blood than they.

[3] My faith would lay its hand
    On that dear head of Thine
    While as a penitent I stand
    And there confess my sin.

[4] My soul looks back to see
    The burden Thou didst bear
    When hanging on the cursed tree
    And knows her guilt was there.

[5] Believing, we rejoice
    To see the curse remove;
    We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice
    And sing His bleeding love.
    Amen
