Hymn #306 - What Wondrous Love Is This
Tune: WONDROUS LOVE
File: elh306.txt

[1] What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul!
    What wondrous love is this, O my soul!
    What wondrous love is this
    That caused the Lord of bliss
    To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul,
    To bear the dreadful curse for my soul?

[2] When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down,
    When I was sinking down, sinking down,
    When I was sinking down
    Beneath God's righteous frown,
    Christ laid aside His crown for my soul, for my soul,
    Christ laid aside His crown for my soul.

[3] To God and to the Lamb I will sing, I will sing;
    To God and to the Lamb I will sing;
    To God and to the Lamb,
    Who is the great I Am,
    While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing,
    While millions join the theme, I will sing.

[4] And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on, I'll sing on;
    And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on.
    And when from death I'm free,
    I'll sing His love for me,
    And through eternity I'll sing on, I'll sing on;
    And through eternity I'll sing on.
    Amen
