Tune: MELITA
File: elh307.txt

[1] I know Thee, Savior! God Thou art,
    Jesus, the feeble sinner's Friend;
    Lord, do not now from me depart,
    But stay, and love me to the end.
    The mercies never shall remove;
    Thy nature and Thy name is Love.

[2] 'Tis Love! 'Tis Love! Thou diedst for me,
    By grace Thou livest in my heart;
    The morning breaks, the shadows flee,
    Pure universal love Thou art.
    To me, to all, Thy mercies move,
    Thy nature and Thy name is Love.
    Amen
