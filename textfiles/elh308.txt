Hymn #308 - When I Survey the Wondrous Cross
Tune: HAMBURG
File: elh308.txt

[1] When I survey the wondrous cross
    On which the Prince of Glory died,
    My richest gain I count but loss
    And pour contempt on all my pride.

[2] Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
    Save in the death of Christ, my God;
    All the vain things that charm me most,
    I sacrifice them to His blood.

[3] See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
    Sorrow and love flow mingled down.
    Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
    Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

[4] Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    That were a tribute far too small;
    Love so amazing, so divine,
    Demands my soul, my life, my all.
    Amen
