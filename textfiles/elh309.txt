Hymn #309 - A Wondrous Mystery Is Here
Tune: WAREHAM
File: elh309.txt

[1] A wondrous mystery is here
    To hold in faith and holy fear:
    The Savior comes as food divine,
    Concealed in earthly bread and wine.

[2] This world is loveless, but above,
    What wondrous boundlessness of love!
    The King of Glory stoops to me
    My spirit's life and strength to be.

[3] In consecrated wine and bread
    No eye perceives the myst'ry spread;
    But Jesus' words are strong and clear:
    "My body and my blood are here."

[4] How dull are all the pow'rs of sense
    Employed on proofs of love immense!
    The richest food lies hid from view,
    The highest gifts we have below.

[5] We have no greater boon on earth,
    And faith alone discerns its worth,
    The Word, not sense, must be our guide,
    Christ's words assure though sight's denied.

[6] Lord, show us still that You are good,
    And grant us evermore this food
    To strengthen ev'ry humble soul
    And make each wounded spirit whole.
    Amen
