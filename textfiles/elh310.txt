Hymn #310 - At the Lamb's High Feast We Sing
Tune: SONNE DER GERECHTIGKEIT
File: elh310.txt

[1] At the Lamb's high feast we sing
    Praise to our victorious King,
    Who has washed us in the tide
    Flowing from His pierced side.
    Alleluia!

[2] Praise we Him whose love divine
    Gives His sacred blood for wine,
    Gives His body for the feast--
    Christ the victim, Christ the priest.
    Alleluia!

[3] Where the paschal blood is poured,
    Death's dread angel sheathes the sword;
    Israel's hosts triumphant go
    Through the wave that drowns the foe.
    Alleluia!

[4] Praise we Christ, whose blood was shed,
    Paschal victim, paschal bread;
    With sincerity and love
    Eat we manna from above.
    Alleluia!

[5] Mighty Victim from the sky,
    Hell's fierce pow'rs beneath You lie;
    You have conquered in the fight,
    You have brought us life and light.
    Alleluia!

[6] Now no more can death appall,
    Now no more the grave enthrall;
    You have opened paradise,
    And Your saints in You shall rise.
    Alleluia!

[7] Easter triumph, Easter joy!
    This alone can sin destroy;
    From sin's pow'r, Lord, set us free,
    Newborn souls in You to be.
    Alleluia!

[8] Father, who the crown shall give,
    Savior, by whose death we live,
    Spirit, guide through all our days:
    Three in One, Your name we praise.
    Alleluia!
    Amen
