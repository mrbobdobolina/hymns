Tune: HERR JESU CHRIST, DICH
File: elh311.txt

[1] Lord Jesus Christ, we humbly pray
    That we may feed on Thee today;
    Beneath these forms of bread and wine
    Enrich us with Thy grace divine.

[2] The chastened peace of sin forgiv'n,
    The fellowship of heirs of heav'n,
    Grant as we share this wondrous food,
    Thy body broken and Thy blood.

[3] Our trembling hearts cleave to Thy Word;
    All Thou hast said Thou dost afford,
    All that Thou art we here receive,
    And all we are to Thee we give.

[4] One bread, one cup, one body, we,
    United by our life in Thee,
    Thy love proclaim till Thou shalt come
    To bring Thy scattered loved ones home.

[5] Lord Jesus Christ, we humbly pray
    To keep us steadfast to that day
    That each may be Thy welcomed guest
    When Thou shalt spread Thy heav'nly feast.
    Amen
