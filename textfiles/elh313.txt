Tune: ICH STERBE TAGLICH
File: elh313.txt

[1] I come, O Savior, to Thy table,
    For weak and weary is my soul;
    Thou, Bread of Life, alone art able
    To satisfy and make me whole.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[2] O grant that I in manner worthy
    May now approach Thy heav'nly Board
    And, as I lowly bow before Thee,
    Look only unto Thee, O Lord.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[3] Unworthy though I am, O Savior,
    Because I have a sinful heart,
    Yet Thou Thy lamb wilt banish never,
    For Thou my faithful Shepherd art.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[4] O let me loathe all sin forever
    As death and poison to my soul,
    That I through willful sinning never
    May see Thy judgment take its toll!

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[5] Thy heart is filled with fervent yearning
    That sinners may salvation see
    Who, Lord, to Thee in faith are turning;
    So I, a sinner, come to Thee.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[6] Weary am I and heavy laden,
    With sin my soul is sore oppressed.
    Receive me graciously and gladden
    My heart, for I am now Thy guest.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[7] Thou here wilt find a heart most lowly
    That humbly falls before Thy feet,
    That duly weeps o'er sin, yet solely
    Thy merit pleads, as it is meet.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[8] By faith I call Thy holy table
    The testament of Thy deep love;
    For, lo, thereby I now am able
    To see how love Thy heart doth move.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[9] What higher gift can we inherit?
    It is faith's bond and solid base;
    It is the strength of heart and spirit,
    The covenant of hope and grace.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[10] This feast is manna, wealth abounding
     Unto the poor, to weak ones pow'r,
     To angels joy, to hell confounding,
     And life for me in death's dark hour.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[11] Thy body, giv'n for me, O Savior,
     Thy blood which Thou for me didst shed,
     These are my life and strength forever,
     By them my hungry soul is fed.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[12] With Thee, Lord, I am now united;
     I live in Thee and Thou in me.
     No sorrow fills my soul, delighted
     It finds its only joy in Thee.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[13] Who can condemn me now? For surely
     The Lord is nigh, who justifies.
     No hell I fear, and thus securely
     With Jesus I to heaven rise.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[14] Though death may threaten with disaster,
     It cannot rob me of my cheer,
     For He who is of death the Master
     With aid and comfort e'er is near.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!

[15] My heart has now become Thy dwelling,
     O blessed, holy Trinity.
     With angels I, Thy praises telling,
     Shall live in joy eternally.

[Refrain] Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood
          Be for my soul the highest good!
          Amen
