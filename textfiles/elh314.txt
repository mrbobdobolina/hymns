Hymn #314 - Draw Nigh and Take the Body of the Lord
Tune: LAMMAS
File: elh314.txt

[1] Draw nigh and take the body of the Lord,
    And drink the holy blood for you outpoured.

[2] By that pure body and that holy blood
    Saved and refreshed, we render thanks to God.

[3] Salvation's Giver, Christ, the only Son,
    By His dear cross and blood the world hath won.

[4] Offered was he for greatest and for least,
    Himself the victim and Himself the priest.

[5] Victims were offered by the law of old,
    Which in a type this heav'nly myst'ry hold.

[6] He, Lord of light, and Savior of our race,
    Hath given to His saints a wondrous grace.

[7] Approach ye, then, with faithful hearts sincere,
    And take the earnest of salvation here.

[8] He who His saints in this world rules and shields,
    To all believers life eternal yields.

[9] He feeds the hungry with the bread of heav'n,
    And living streams to those who thirst are giv'n.

[10] Alpha and Omega, to whom shall bow
     All nations at the doom, is with us now.
     Amen
