Hymn #315 - Jesus, The Very Thought of Thee
Tune: CLAIRVAUX
File: elh315.txt

[1] Jesus, the very thought of Thee
    With sweetness fills the breast;
    But sweeter far Thy face to see,
    And in Thy presence rest.

[2] Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
    Nor can the mem'ry find
    A sweeter sound than Thy blest name,
    O Savior of mankind!

[3] O Hope of ev'ry contrite heart,
    O Joy of all the meek!
    To those who fall, how kind Thou art,
    How good to those who seek!

[4] But what to those who find? Ah! this
    Nor tongue nor pen can show;
    The love of Jesus, what it is,
    None but His loved ones know.

[5] Jesus, our only Joy be Thou
    As Thou our Prize wilt be;
    Jesus, be Thou our Glory now
    And through eternity.
    Amen
