Hymn #316 - Jesus Christ, Our Blessed Savior
Tune: JESUS CHRISTUS, UNSER HEILAND
File: elh316.txt

[1] Jesus Christ, our blessed Savior,
    Turned away God's wrath forever;
    By His bitter grief and woe
    He saved us from the evil foe.

[2] As His pledge of love undying
    He, this precious food supplying,
    Gives His body with the bread
    And with the wine the blood He shed.

[3] Whoso to this Board repaireth
    May take heed how he prepareth;
    For if he does not believe,
    Then death for life he shall receive.

[4] Praise the Father, who from heaven
    Unto us such food hath given
    And, to mend what we have done,
    Gave into death His only Son.

[5] Thou shalt hold with faith unshaken
    That this food is to be taken
    By the sick who are distressed,
    By hearts that long for peace and rest.

[6] Christ says: "Come, all ye that labor,
    And receive My grace and favor;
    They who feel no want nor ill
    Need no physician's help nor skill.

[7] "Useless were for thee My Passion
    If thy works thy weal could fashion.
    This feast is not spread for thee
    If thine own savior thou wilt be."

[8] If thy heart this truth professes
    And thy mouth thy sin confesses,
    His dear guest thou here shalt be,
    And Christ Himself shall banquet thee.
    Amen
