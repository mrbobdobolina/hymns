Tune: JESU DULCIS MEMORIA
File: elh318.txt

[1] Jesus, Thou Joy of loving hearts!
    Thou Fount of life, Thou Light of men!
    From the best bliss that earth imparts,
    We turn, unfilled, to Thee again.

[2] Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;
    Thou savest those that on Thee call;
    To them that seek Thee Thou are good,
    To them that find Thee, all in all.

[3] We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,
    And long to feast upon Thee still;
    We drink of Thee, the Fountain head,
    And thirst our souls from Thee to fill.

[4] Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,
    Where'er our changeful lot is cast;
    Glad that Thy gracious smile we see,
    Blest that our faith can hold Thee fast.

[5] O Jesus, ever with us stay
    Make all our moments calm and bright;
    Chase the dark night of sin away,
    Shed o'er the world Thy holy light.
    Amen
