Tune: ALLES IST AN GOTTES SEGEN
File: elh321.txt

[1] Zion, to thy Savior singing,
    To thy prince and shepherd bringing
    Sweetest hymns of love and praise,
    Thou wilt never reach the measure
    Of His worth, by all the treasure
    Of thy most ecstatic lays

[2] Of all wonders that can thrill thee,
    And with adoration fill thee,
    What than this can greater be,
    That Himself to thee He giveth?
    He that eateth ever liveth,
    For the Bread of life is He.

[3] Fill thy lips to overflowing
    With sweet praise, His mercy showing
    Who this heav'nly table spread:
    On this day so glad and holy,
    To each longing spirit lowly
    Giveth He the living bread.

[4] Here the King hath spread His table
    Whereon eyes of faith are able
    Christ our Passover to trace:
    Shadows of the law are going,
    Light and life and truth inflowing,
    Night to day is giving place.

[5] Lo, this blessed food descending
    Heav'nly love is hither sending,
    Hungry lips on earth to feed:
    So the paschal lamb was given,
    So the manna came from heaven,
    Isaac was His type indeed.

[6] O good Shepherd, Bread life-giving,
    Us, Thy grace and life receiving,
    Feed and shelter evermore;
    Thou on earth our footsteps guiding,
    We in heav'n with Thee abiding,
    With all saints will Thee adore.
    Amen
