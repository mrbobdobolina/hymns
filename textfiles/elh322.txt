Hymn #322 - Lord Jesus Christ, Thou Living Bread
Tune: HERR, WIE DU WILLST
File: elh322.txt

[1] Lord Jesus Christ, Thou living Bread,
    May I for mine possess Thee.
    I would with heav'nly food be fed;
    Descend, refresh, and bless me.
    Now make me meet for Thee, O Lord;
    Now, humbly by my heart implored,
    Grant me Thy grace and mercy.

[2] Thou me to pastures green dost guide,
    To quiet waters lead me;
    Thy Table Thou dost well provide
    And from Thy hand dost feed me.
    Sin, weakness, and infirmity
    Am I; O Savior, give to me
    The cup of Thy salvation.

[3] O Bread of Heav'n, my soul's Delight,
    For full and free remission
    With prayer I come before Thy sight,
    In sorrow and contrition.
    With faith adorn my soul that I
    May to Thy Table now draw nigh
    With Thine own preparation.

[4] I merit not Thy favor, Lord,
    Sin now upon me lieth;
    Beneath my burden, self-abhorred,
    To Thee my spirit crieth.
    In all my grief this comforts me,
    That Thou on sinners graciously,
    Lord Jesus, hast compassion.
    Amen
