Hymn #323 - My God, and Is Thy Table Spread
Tune: HERRNHUT
File: elh323.txt

[1] My God, and is Thy table spread,
    And does thy cup with love o'erflow?
    Thither be all Thy children led
    And let them all its sweetness know.

[2] Hail, sacred feast, which Jesus makes,
    Rich banquet of His flesh and blood!
    Thrice happy he who here partakes
    That sacred stream, that heav'nly flood.

[3] O let Thy table honored be
    And furnished well with worthy guests;
    And may each soul salvation see
    That here its sacred pledges tastes!
    Amen
