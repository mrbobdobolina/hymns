File: elh325.txt

[1] O Jesus, blessed Lord, to Thee
    My heartfelt thanks forever be,
    Who hast so lovingly bestowed
    On me Thy body and Thy blood.

[2] Break forth, my soul, for joy and say:
    What wealth is come to me this day!
    My Savior dwells within me now:
    How blest am I! How good art Thou!
    Amen
