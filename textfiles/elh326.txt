Tune: NUN LOB, MEIN SEEL
File: elh326.txt

[1] O living Bread from heaven,
    How richly hast Thou fed Thy guest!
    The gifts Thou now hast given
    Have filled my hearts with joy and rest.
    O wondrous food of blessing,
    O cup that heals our woes!
    My heart, this gift professing,
    In thankful songs o'erflows;
    For while the faith within me
    Was quickened by this food,
    My soul hath gazed upon Thee,
    My highest, only Good.

[2] My God, Thou here hast led me
    Within Thy temple's holiest place
    And there Thyself hast fed me
    With all the treasures of Thy grace.
    O boundless is Thy kindness,
    And righteous is Thy pow'r,
    While I in sinful blindness
    Am erring hour by hour;
    And yet Thou com'st not spurning
    A sinner, Lord, like me!
    Thy grace and love returning,
    What gift have I for Thee?

[3] A heart that hath repented
    And mourns for sin with bitter sighs--
    Thou, Lord, art well contented
    With this my only sacrifice.
    I know that in my weakness
    Thou wilt despise me not,
    But grant me in Thy meekness
    The blessing I have sought;
    Yes, Thou wilt hear with favor
    The song that now I raise,
    For meet and right 'tis ever
    That I should sing Thy praise.

[4] Grant what I have partaken
    May through Thy grace so work in me
    That sin be all forsaken
    And I may cleave alone to Thee
    And all my soul be heedful
    How I Thy love may know;
    For this alone is needful
    Thy love should in me glow.
    Then let no beauty ever,
    No joy, allure my heart,
    But what is Thine, my Savior,
    What Thou dost here impart.

[5] O well for me that, strengthened
    With heav'nly food and comfort here,
    Howe'er my course be lengthened,
    I now may serve Thee free from fear!
    Away, then, earthly pleasure!
    All earthly gifts are vain;
    I seek a heav'nly treasure,
    My home I long to gain,
    My God, where I shall praise Thee,
    Where none my peace destroy
    And where my soul shall raise Thee
    Glad song in endless joy.
    Amen
