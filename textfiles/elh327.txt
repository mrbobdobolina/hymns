Tune: GOTT SEI GELOBET UND GEBENEDEIET
File: elh327.txt

[1] O Lord, we praise Thee, bless Thee, and adore Thee,
    In thanksgiving bow before Thee.
    Thou with Thy body and Thy blood didst nourish
    Our weak souls that they may flourish.
    O Lord, have mercy!
    May Thy body, Lord, born of Mary,
    That our sins and sorrows did carry,
    And Thy blood for us plead
    In all trial, fear, and need:
    O Lord, have mercy!

[2] Thy holy body into death was given,
    Life to win for us in heaven.
    No greater love than this to Thee could bind us;
    May this feast thereof remind us!
    O Lord, have mercy!
    Lord, Thy kindness did so constrain Thee
    That Thy blood should bless and sustain me.
    All our debt Thou hast paid;
    Peace with God once more is made:
    O Lord, have mercy!

[3] May God bestow on us His grace and favor
    To please Him with our behavior
    And live as brethren here in love and union
    Nor repent this blest Communion!
    O Lord, have mercy!
    Let not Thy good Spirit forsake us;
    Grant that heav'nly-minded He make us;
    Give Thy Church, Lord, to see
    Days of peace and unity:
    O Lord, have mercy!
    Amen
