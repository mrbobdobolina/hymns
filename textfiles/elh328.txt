Tune: SCHMUCKE DICH
File: elh328.txt

[1] Soul, adorn thyself with gladness,
    Leave behind all gloom and sadness;
    Come into the daylight's splendor,
    There with joy thy praises render
    Unto Him whose grace unbounded
    Hath this wondrous Supper founded.
    High o'er all the heav'ns He reigneth,
    Yet to dwell with thee He deigneth.

[2] Hasten as a bride to meet Him,
    And with loving rev'rence greet Him;
    For with words of life immortal
    Now He knocketh at thy portal.
    Haste to ope the gates before Him,
    Saying, while thou dost adore Him:
    Suffer, Lord, that I receive Thee,
    And I nevermore will leave Thee.

[3] He who craves a precious treasure
    Neither cost nor pain will measure;
    But the priceless gifts of heaven
    God to us hath freely given.
    Though the wealth of earth were proffered,
    Naught would buy the gifts here offered:
    Christ's true body, for thee riven,
    And His blood, for thee once given.

[4] Ah, how hungers all my spirit
    For the love I do not merit!
    Oft have I, with sighs fast thronging,
    Thought upon this food with longing,
    In the battle well-nigh worsted,
    For this cup of life have thirsted,
    For the Friend who here invites us
    And to God Himself unites us.

[5] In my heart I find ascending
    Holy awe, with rapture blending,
    As this mystery I ponder,
    Filling all my soul with wonder,
    Bearing witness at this hour
    Of the greatness of God's power;
    Far beyond all human telling
    Is the pow'r within Him dwelling.

[6] Human reason, though it ponder,
    Cannot fathom this great wonder,
    That Christ's body e'er remaineth
    Though it countless souls sustaineth,
    And that He His blood is giving
    With the wine we are receiving.
    The great mysteries unsounded
    Are by God alone expounded.

[7] Jesus, Sun of Life, my Splendor,
    Jesus, Thou my Friend most tender,
    Jesus, Joy of my desiring,
    Fount of life, my soul inspiring--
    At Thy feet I cry, my Maker:
    Let me be a fit partaker
    Of this blessed food from heaven,
    For our good, Thy glory, given.

[8] Lord, by love and mercy driven
    Thou hast left Thy throne in heaven
    On the cross for me to languish
    And to die in bitter anguish,
    To forgo all joy and gladness
    And to shed Thy blood in sadness.
    By this blood redeemed and living,
    Lord, I praise Thee with thanksgiving.

[9] Jesus, Bread of Life, I pray Thee,
    Let me gladly here obey Thee.
    By Thy love I am invited;
    Be Thy love with love requited.
    From this Supper let me measure,
    Lord, how vast and deep love's treasure.
    Through the gifts Thou here dost give me
    As Thy guest in heav'n receive me.
    Amen
