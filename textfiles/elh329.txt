Hymn #329 - The Death of Jesus Christ, Our Lord
Tune: GOTTLOB, ES GEHT NUNMEHR ZU ENDE
File: elh329.txt

[1] The death of Jesus Christ, our Lord,
    We celebrate with one accord;
    It is our comfort in distress,
    Our heart's sweet joy and happiness.

[2] He blotted out with His own blood
    The judgment that against us stood;
    He full atonement for us made,
    And all our debt He fully paid.

[3] That this is now and ever true
    He gives an earnest ever new;
    In this His holy Supper here
    We taste His love so sweet, so near.

[4] His Word proclaims and we believe.
    That in this Supper we receive
    His very body, as He said,
    His very blood for sinners shed.

[5] A precious food is this indeed--
    It never fails us in our need--
    A heav'nly manna for our soul
    Until we safely reach our goal.

[6] O blest is each believing guest
    Who in this promise finds his rest,
    For Jesus will in love abide
    With those who do in Him confide.

[7] The guest that comes with true intent
    To turn to God and to repent,
    To live for Christ, to die to sin,
    Will thus a holier life begin.

[8] They who His Word do not believe,
    This food unworthily receive,
    Salvation here will never find--
    May we this warning keep in mind!

[9] O Jesus Christ, our Brother dear,
    Unto Thy cross we now draw near;
    Thy sacred wounds indeed make whole
    A wounded and benighted soul.

[10] Help us sincerely to believe
     That we may worthily receive
     Thy Supper and in Thee find rest.
     Amen! All who believe are blest.
     Amen
