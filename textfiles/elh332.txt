Hymn #332 - O Darkest Woe
Tune: O TRAURIGKEIT
File: elh332.txt

[1] O darkest woe!
    Ye tears, forth flow!
    Has earth so sad a wonder,
    That the Father's only Son
    Now lies buried yonder!

[2] O sorrow dread!
    Our God is dead,
    He paid our great redemption.
    Jesus' death upon the cross
    Gained for us salvation.

[3] O sinful man!
    It was the ban
    Of death on thee that brought Him
    Down to suffer for thy sins
    And such woe hath wrought Him.

[4] O ground of faith,
    Laid low in death!
    Sweet lips now silent sleeping:
    Surely all that live must mourn
    Here with bitter weeping.

[5] O blest shall be
    Eternally
    Who oft in faith will ponder
    Why the glorious Prince of Life
    Should be buried yonder.

[6] O Jesus blest,
    My Help and Rest,
    With tears I now entreat Thee:
    Make me love Thee to the last,
    Till in heav'n I greet Thee!
    Amen
