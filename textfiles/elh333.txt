Tune: JESU, MEINES LEBENS LEBEN
File: elh333.txt

[1] Christ, the Life of all the living,
    Christ, the Death of death, our foe,
    Who, Thyself for me once giving
    To the darkest depths of woe--
    Through Thy suff'rings, death, and merit
    I eternal life inherit;
    Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
    Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

[2] Thou, ah, Thou, hast taken on Thee
    Bonds and stripes, a cruel rod;
    Pain and scorn were heaped upon Thee,
    O Thou sinless Son of God!
    Thus didst Thou my soul deliver
    From the bonds of sin forever.
    Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
    Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

[3] Thou hast borne the smiting only
    That my wounds might all be whole;
    Thou hast suffered, sad and lonely,
    Rest to give my weary soul;
    Yea, the curse of God enduring,
    Blessing unto me securing.
    Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
    Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

[4] Heartless scoffers did surround Thee,
    Treating Thee with cruel scorn,
    And with piercing thorns they crowned Thee.
    All disgrace Thou, Lord, hast borne
    That as Thine Thou mightest own me
    And with heav'nly glory crown me.
    Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
    Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

[5] Thou hast suffered me to bruise Thee
    That from pain I might be free;
    Falsely did Thy foes accuse Thee--
    Thence I gain security;
    Comfortless Thy soul did languish
    Me to comfort in my anguish.
    Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
    Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

[6] Thou has suffered great affliction
    And hast borne it patiently,
    Even death by crucifixion,
    Fully to atone for me;
    Thou didst choose to be tormented
    That my doom should be prevented.
    Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
    Dearest Jesus, unto Thee.

[7] Then, for all that wrought my pardon,
    For Thy sorrows deep and sore,
    For Thine anguish in the Garden,
    I will thank Thee evermore,
    Thank Thee for Thy groaning, sighing,
    For Thy bleeding and Thy dying,
    For that last triumphant cry,
    And shall praise Thee, Lord, on high.
    Amen
