Hymn #335 - O Sacred Head, Now Wounded
Tune: HERZLICH TUT MICH VERLANGEN
File: elh335.txt

[1] O sacred Head, now wounded,
    With grief and shame weighed down,
    Now scornfully surrounded
    With thorns, Thine only crown.
    O sacred head, what glory,
    What bliss, till now was Thine;
    Yet, though despised and gory,
    I joy to call Thee mine.

[2] Men mock and taunt and jeer Thee,
    Thou noble face of Christ;
    Though mighty worlds shall fear Thee,
    How art Thou now despised?
    How art Thou pale with anguish,
    With sore abuse and scorn!
    How doth Thy face now languish
    That once was bright as morn!

[3] Now from Thy cheeks has vanished
    Their color, once so fair;
    From Thy red lips is banished
    The splendor that was there.
    Grim death, with cruel rigor,
    Hath robbed Thee of Thy life;
    Thus Thou hast lost Thy vigor,
    Thy strength, in this sad strife.

[4] What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered
    Was all for sinners' gain:
    Mine, mine was the transgression,
    But thine the deadly pain:
    Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
    'Tis I deserve Thy place;
    Look on me with Thy favor,
    Vouchsafe to me Thy grace.

[5] My Shepherd, now receive me!
    My Guardian, own me Thine!
    Great blessings Thou didst give me,
    O Source of gifts divine!
    Thy lips have often fed me
    With milk and sweetest food;
    Thy Spirit oft has led me
    To stores of heav'nly good.

[6] What language shall I borrow
    To thank Thee, dearest Friend,
    For this, Thy dying sorrow,
    Thy pity without end?
    O make me Thine forever!
    And should I fainting be,
    Lord, let me never, never,
    Outlive my love for Thee.

[7] The joy can ne'er be spoken,
    Above all joys beside,
    When in Thy body broken
    I thus with safety hide.
    O Lord of life, desiring
    Thy glory now to see,
    Beside Thy cross expiring,
    I'd breathe my soul to Thee.

[8] Be Thou my consolation,
    My Shield when I must die;
    Remind me of Thy Passion
    When my last hour draws nigh.
    Mine eyes shall then behold Thee,
    Upon Thy cross shall dwell,
    My heart by faith enfold Thee,
    Who dieth thus dies well!

[9] And when I am departing,
    O part not Thou from me;
    When mortal pangs are darting,
    Come, Lord, and set me free:
    And when my heart must languish
    Amidst the final throe,
    Release me from mine anguish
    By Thine own pain and woe.
    Amen
