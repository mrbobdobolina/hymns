Hymn #337 - Our Blessed Savior Seven Times Spoke
Tune: DA JESUS AN DES KREUZES
File: elh337.txt

[1] Our blessed Savior sev'n times spoke
    When on the cross our sins He took
    And died lest we should perish.
    Let us His last and dying words
    In our remembrance cherish.

[2] "Father, forgive these men; for, lo,
    They truly know not what they do."
    So far His love extended.
    Forgive us, Lord, for we, too, have
    Through ignorance offended.

[3] Now to the contrite thief He cries:
    "Thou, verily, in Paradise
    Shalt meet Me ere tomorrow."
    Lord, take us to Thy kingdom soon
    Who linger here in sorrow.

[4] To weeping Mary, standing by,
    "Behold thy son," now hear Him cry;
    To John, "Behold thy mother."
    Provide, O Lord, for those we leave;
    Let each befriend the other.

[5] The Savior's fourth word was "I thirst."
    O mighty Prince of Life, Thy thirst
    For us and our salvation
    Is truly great; do help us, then,
    That we escape damnation.

[6] The fifth, "My God, My God, O why
    Forsake Me?" Hark, the awe-full cry!
    Lord, Thou wast here forsaken
    That we might be received on high;
    Let this hope not be shaken.

[7] The sixth, when victory was won,
    "'Tis finished!" for Thy work was done.
    Grant, Lord, that onward pressing,
    We may the work Thou dost impose
    Fulfill with Thine own blessing.

[8] The last, as woe and suff'rings end,
    "O God, My Father, I commend
    Into Thy hands My spirit."
    Be this, dear Lord, my dying wish;
    O heav'nly Father, hear it.

[9] Whoe'er, by sense of sin oppressed,
    Upon these words his thoughts will rest,
    He joy and hope obtaineth
    And through God's love and boundless grace
    A peaceful conscience gaineth.

[10] O Jesus Christ, Thou Crucified,
     Who hast for our offenses died,
     Grant that we e'er may ponder
     Thy wounds, Thy cross, Thy bitter death,
     Both here below and yonder.
     Amen
