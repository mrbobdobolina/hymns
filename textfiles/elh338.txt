Hymn #338 - So Rest, My Rest
Tune: O TRAURIGKEIT
File: elh338.txt

[1] So rest, my Rest,
    Thou Ever-blest!
    Thy grave with sinners making;
    By Thy precious death from sin
    My dead soul awaking.

[2] After Thy strife,
    Life of my life,
    Thy fervent love hath driven
    Thee into the cold, dark grave
    That I might gain heaven.

[3] Breath of all breath!
    I know from death
    Thou wilt my dust awaken;
    Wherefore should I dread the grave
    Or my faith be shaken?

[4] To me the tomb
    Shall be a room
    Where I lie down on roses;
    Who by faith hath conquered death
    Sweetly there reposes.

[5] Meantime I will
    My Savior, still
    Deep in my bosom lay Thee,
    Ever musing on Thy death.
    Leave me not, I pray Thee!
    Amen
