Tune: FRED TIL BOD
File: elh340.txt

[1] Alleluia! Jesus lives!
    He is now the Living One;
    From the gloomy house of death
    Forth the Conqueror has gone,
    Bright Forerunner to the skies
    Of His people, yet to rise.

[2] Jesus lives! Let all rejoice;
    Praise Him, ransomed ones of earth.
    Praise Him in a nobler song,
    Cherubim of heav'nly birth.
    Praise the Victor-King, whose sway
    Sin and death and hell obey.

[3] Jesus lives! Why weepest thou?
    Why that sad and frequent sigh?
    He who died our Brother here
    Lives our Brother still on high,
    Lives forever to bestow
    Blessings on His Church below.

[4] Jesus lives! And thus, my soul,
    Life eternal waits for thee;
    Joined to Him, thy living Head,
    Where He is, thou, too, shalt be;
    With Himself, at His right hand,
    Victor over death shalt stand.

[5] Jesus lives! To Him my heart
    Draws with ever new delight.
    Earthly vanities, depart,
    Hinder not my heav'nward flight.
    Let this spirit ever rise
    To it Magnet in the skies.

[6] Alleluia! Angels, sing!
    Join us in our hymn of praise.
    Let your chorus swell the strain
    Which our feebler voices raise:
    Glory to our God above
    And on earth His peace and love!
    Amen
