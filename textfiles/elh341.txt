Hymn #341 - Awake, My Heart, with Gladness
Tune: AUF, AUF, MEIN HERZ
File: elh341.txt

[1] Awake, my heart, with gladness,
    See what today is done;
    Now, after gloom and sadness,
    Comes forth the glorious Sun.
    My Savior there was laid
    Where our bed must be made
    When to the realms of light
    Our spirit wings its flight.

[2] The foe in triumph shouted
    When Christ lay in the tomb;
    But lo, he now is routed,
    His boast is turned to gloom.
    For Christ again is free;
    In glorious victory
    He who is strong to save
    Has triumphed o'er the grave.

[3] This is a sight that gladdens--
    What peace it does impart!
    Now nothing ever saddens
    The joy within my heart.
    No gloom shall ever shake,
    No foe shall ever take
    The hope which God's own Son
    In love for me has won.

[4] Now hell, its prince, the devil,
    Of all their pow'r are shorn;
    Now I am safe from evil,
    And sin I laugh to scorn.
    Grim death with all its might
    Cannot my soul affright;
    It is a pow'rless form,
    Howe'er it rave and storm.

[5] The world against me rageth,
    Its fury I disdain;
    Though bitter war it wageth,
    Its work is all in vain.
    My heart from care is free,
    No trouble troubles me.
    Misfortune now is play,
    And night is bright as day.

[6] Now I will cling forever
    To Christ, my Savior true;
    My Lord will leave me never,
    Whate'er He passes through.
    He rends death's iron chain;
    He breaks through sin and pain;
    He shatters hell's grim thrall;
    I follow Him through all.

[7] To halls of heav'nly splendor
    With Him I penetrate;
    And trouble ne'er may hinder
    Nor make me hesitate.
    Let tempests rage at will,
    My Savior shields me still;
    He grants abiding peace
    And bids all tumult cease.

[8] He brings me to the portal
    That leads to bliss untold,
    Whereon this rhyme immortal
    Is found in script of gold:
    "Who there My cross hath shared
    Find here a crown prepared;
    Who there with Me has died
    Shall here be glorified."
    Amen
