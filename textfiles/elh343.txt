Hymn #343 - Christ Jesus Lay in Death's Strong Bands
Tune: CHRIST LAG IN TODESBANDEN
File: elh343.txt

[1] Christ Jesus lay in death's strong bands,
    For our offenses given;
    But now at God's right hand He stands
    And brings us life from heaven;
    Therefore let us joyful be
    And sing to God right thankfully
    Loud songs of alleluia!
    Alleluia!

[2] No son of man could conquer death,
    Such mischief sin had wrought us,
    For innocence dwelt not on earth,
    And therefore death had brought us
    Into thraldom from of old
    And ever grew more strong and bold
    And kept us in its bondage.
    Alleluia!

[3] But Jesus Christ, God's only Son,
    To our low state descended,
    The cause of death He has undone,
    Its pow'r forever ended,
    Ruined all its right and claim
    And left it nothing but the name,
    Its sting is lost forever.
    Alleluia!

[4] It was a strange and dreadful strife
    When Life and Death contended.
    The victory remained with life,
    The reign of death was ended;
    Holy Scripture plainly saith
    That death is swallowed up by death,
    In vain its rages o'er us.
    Alleluia!

[5] Here the true Paschal Lamb we see,
    Whom God so freely gave us;
    He died on the accursed tree--
    So strong His love--to save us.
    See, His blood doth mark our door;
    Faith points to it, death passes o'er,
    And Satan cannot harm us.
    Alleluia!

[6] So let us keep the festival
    Whereto the Lord invites us;
    Christ is Himself the Joy of all,
    The Sun that warms and lights us.
    By His grace He doth impart
    Eternal sunshine to the heart;
    The night of sin is ended.
    Alleluia!

[7] Then let us feast this Easter Day
    On Christ, the Bread of heaven;
    The Word of Grace hath purged away
    The old and evil leaven.
    Christ alone our souls will feed,
    He is our meat and drink indeed;
    Faith lives upon no other.
    Alleluia!
    Amen
