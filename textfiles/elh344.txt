Tune: CHRIST IST ERSTANDEN
File: elh344.txt

[1] Christ the Lord is ris'n again;
    Christ has broken death's strong chain.
    Hark, the angels shout for joy,
    Singing evermore on high:
    Alleluia!
    He who gave for us His life,
    Who for us endured the strife,
    Is our Paschal Lamb today.
    We, too, sing for joy and say:
    Alleluia!

[Refrain] Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
          Christ our Paschal Lamb indeed,
          Christ, today Your people feed.
          Alleluia!

[2] He who bore all pain and loss
    Comfortless upon the cross
    Lives in glory now on high,
    Pleads for us and hears our cry:
    Alleluia!
    He whose path no records tell
    Hath descended into hell;
    He the strong man armed hath bound
    And in highest heav'n is crowned.
    Alleluia!

[Refrain] Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
          Christ our Paschal Lamb indeed,
          Christ, today Your people feed.
          Alleluia!

[3] He who slumbered in the grave
    Is exalted now to save;
    Now through Christendom it rings
    That the Lamb is King of kings.
    Alleluia!
    Now He bids us tell abroad
    How the lost may be restored,
    How the penitent forgiv'n,
    How we, too, may enter heav'n.
    Alleluia!

[Refrain] Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
          Christ our Paschal Lamb indeed,
          Christ, today Your people feed.
          Alleluia!
          Amen
