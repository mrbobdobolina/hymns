[1] Christ the Lord is ris'n today;
    Alleluia!
    Christians, haste your vows to pay;
    Alleluia!
    Offer ye your praises meet
    Alleluia!
    At the Paschal Victim's feet.
    Alleluia!

[2] For the sheep the Lamb hath bled,
    Alleluia!
    Sinless in the sinner's stead.
    Alleluia!
    "Christ is ris'n," today we cry;
    Alleluia!
    Now He lives no more to die.
    Alleluia!

[3] Christ, the Victim undefiled,
    Alleluia!
    God and man hath reconciled,
    Alleluia!
    While in strange and aweful strife
    Alleluia!
    Met together death and life.
    Alleluia!

[4] Christians, on this happy day
    Alleluia!
    Haste your joy your vows to pay.
    Alleluia!
    "Christ is ris'n," today we cry;
    Alleluia!
    Now He lives no more to die.
    Alleluia!

[5] Christ, who once for sinners bled,
    Alleluia!
    Now the First-born from the dead,
    Alleluia!
    Throned in endless might and pow'r,
    Alleluia!
    Lives and reigns forevermore.
    Alleluia!

[6] Hail, eternal Hope on high!
    Alleluia!
    Hail, Thou King of victory!
    Alleluia!
    Hail, Thou Prince of Life adored!
    Alleluia!
    Help and save us, gracious Lord.
    Alleluia!
    Amen
