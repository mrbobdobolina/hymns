Hymn #346 - Death Is Dead, the True Life Liveth
Tune: REGENT SQUARE
File: elh346.txt

[1] Death is dead, the true Life liveth!
    O'er the portals of the grave
    Life's great Sun bright-shinning giveth
    Light our darkened souls to save:
    Christ arisen bursts our prison;
    See His triumph-banners wave.

[2] Life's own King on Calv'ry dying,
    Wins a crown of life for me;
    E'en the grave to Him complying
    Flow'rs in life abundant free;
    Death's chill sadness changed to gladness--
    This the Easter victory!

[3] He who rose from death all-glorious
    Soon will gather to His side
    Those who sleep in Him, victorious
    By the blood His wounds supplied;
    Flesh and spirit, through His merit,
    Reunited, glorified.

[4] Jesus, death's Destroyer, make me
    Day by day to die with Thee;
    Thus, with Thee arising, take me
    Thine through all the days to be--
    Thine forever, faithless never--
    This may prayer unceasingly.
    Amen
