Hymn #348 - He Is Arisen! Glorious Word!
Tune: WIE SCHON LEUCHTET
File: elh348.txt

[1] He is arisen! Glorious Word!
    Now reconciled is God, my Lord;
    The gates of heav'n are open.
    My Jesus did triumphantly,
    And Satan's arrows broken lie,
    Destroyed hell's direst weapon.
    O hear What cheer! Christ victorious
    Riseth glorious, Life He giveth--
    He was dead, but see, He liveth!
    Amen
