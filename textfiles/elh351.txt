Hymn #351 - I Know that My Redeemer Lives
Tune: DUKE STREET
File: elh351.txt

[1] I know that my Redeemer lives;
    What comfort this sweet sentence gives!
    He lives, He lives, who once was dead;
    He lives, my everliving Head.

[2] He lives triumphant from the grave;
    He lives eternally to save.
    He lives all-glorious in the sky;
    He lives exalted there on high.

[3] He lives to bless me with His love;
    He lives to plead for me above.
    He lives my hungry soul to feed;
    He lives to help in time of need.

[4] He lives to grant me rich supply;
    He lives to guide me with His eye.
    He lives to comfort me when faint;
    He lives to hear my soul's complaint.

[5] He lives to silence all my fears;
    He lives to wipe away my tears.
    He lives to calm my troubled heart;
    He lives all blessings to impart.

[6] He lives my kind, wise, heav'nly Friend;
    He lives and loves me to the end.
    He lives, and while he lives, I'll sing;
    He lives, my Prophet, Priest, and King.

[7] He lives and grants me daily breath;
    He lives, and I shall conquer death.
    He lives my mansion to prepare;
    He lives to bring me safely there.

[8] He lives, all glory to His name!
    He lives, my Jesus, still the same.
    O the sweet joy this sentence gives:
    "I know that my Redeemer lives!"
    Amen
