Tune: EASTER HYMN
File: elh352.txt

[1] Jesus Christ is ris'n today,
    Alleluia!
    Our triumphant holy day,
    Alleluia!
    Who did once upon the cross,
    Alleluia!
    Suffer to redeem our loss.
    Alleluia!

[2] Hymns of praise, then, let us sing,
    Alleluia!
    Unto Christ, our heav'nly King,
    Alleluia!
    Who endured the cross and grave,
    Alleluia!
    Sinners to redeem and save.
    Alleluia!

[3] But the pains which He endured,
    Alleluia!
    Our salvation have procured.
    Alleluia!
    Now above the sky He's King,
    Alleluia!
    Where the angels ever sing.
    Alleluia!

[4] Sing we to our God above,
    Alleluia!
    Praise eternal as His love,
    Alleluia!
    Praise Him, all ye heav'nly host,
    Alleluia!
    Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
    Alleluia!
    Amen
