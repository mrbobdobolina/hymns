Hymn #353 - Jesus Lives! The Victory's Won
Tune: JESUS, MEINE ZUVERSICHT
File: elh353.txt

[1] Jesus lives! The vict'ry's won!
    Death no longer can appal me.
    Jesus lives! Death's reign is done!
    From the grave He will recall me.
    Brighter scenes will then commence;
    This shall be my confidence.

[2] Jesus lives! To Him the throne
    High o'er heav'n and earth is given.
    I shall go where He is gone,
    Live and reign with Him in heaven.
    God through Christ forgives offense;
    This shall be my confidence.

[3] Jesus lives! For me He died;
    Hence will I, to Jesus living,
    Pure in heart and act abide,
    Praise to Him and glory giving.
    Freely God doth aid dispense;
    This shall be my confidence.

[4] Jesus lives! I know full well
    Naught from me His love shall sever,
    Life nor death nor pow'rs of hell
    Part me now from Christ forever.
    God will be my sure defense;
    This shall be my confidence.

[5] Jesus lives! Henceforth is death
    But the gate of life immortal;
    This shall calm my trembling breath
    When I pass its gloomy portal.
    Faith shall cry, as fails each sense,
    "Lord, Thou art my confidence."
    Amen
