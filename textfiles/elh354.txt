Hymn #354 - Like the Golden Sun Ascending
Tune: WERDE MUNTER
File: elh354.txt

[1] Like the golden sun ascending,
    Breaking through the gloom of night,
    On the earth his glory spending
    So that darkness takes to flight,
    Thus my Jesus from the grave
    And death's dismal, dreadful cave,
    Rose triumphant Easter morning,
    At the early purple dawning.

[2] Thanks to Thee, O Christ victorious!
    Thanks to Thee, O Lord of life!
    Death hath now no power o'er us,
    Thou hast conquered in the strife.
    Thanks because Thou didst arise
    And hast opened Paradise!
    None can fully sing the glory
    Of the resurrection story.

[3] For my heart finds consolation
    And my fainting soul grows brave
    When I stand in contemplation
    At Thy dark and dismal grave;
    When I see where Thou didst sleep
    In death's dungeon dark and deep,
    Yet didst break all bands asunder,
    Must I not rejoice and wonder?

[4] Though I be by sin o'ertaken,
    Though I lie in helplessness,
    Though I be by friends forsaken,
    And must suffer sore distress,
    Though I be despised, contemned,
    And by all the world condemned,
    Though the dark grave yawn before me,
    Yet the light of hope shines o'er me.

[5] Thou hast died for my transgression,
    All my sins on Thee were laid;
    Thou hast won for me salvation,
    On the cross my debt was paid.
    From the grave I shall arise
    And shall meet Thee in the skies.
    Death itself is transitory;
    I shall lift my head in glory.

[6] Satan's arrows all lie broken
    Death and hell have met their doom;
    Christ, Thy rising is the token:
    Thou hast triumphed o'er the tomb.
    Thou hast buried all my woe,
    And my cup doth overflow;
    By Thy resurrection glorious
    I shall wave my palms victorious.

[7] As the Son of God I know Thee,
    For I see Thy sov'reign pow'r;
    Sin and death shall not o'erthrow me
    Even in my dying hour;
    For Thy resurrection is
    Surety for my heav'nly bliss,
    And my baptism a reflection
    Of Thy death and resurrection.

[8] Unto life Thou shalt arouse me
    By Thy resurrection's pow'r;
    Though the hideous grave shall house me,
    And my flesh the worms devour;
    Fire and water may destroy
    My frail body, yet with joy
    I shall rise as Thou hast risen
    From the deep sepulchral prison.

[9] Grant me grace, O blessed Savior,
    And Thy Holy Spirit send
    That my walk and my behavior
    May be pleasing to the end;
    That I may not fall again
    Into Death's grim pit and pain,
    Whence by grace Thou hast retrieved me
    And from which Thou hast relieved me.

[10] For the joy Thy birth doth give me,
     For Thy holy, precious Word;
     For Thy baptism, which doth save me,
     For Thy blest Communion board;
     For Thy death, the bitter scorn,
     For Thy resurrection morn,
     Lord, I thank Thee and extol Thee,
     And in heav'n I shall behold Thee.
     Amen
