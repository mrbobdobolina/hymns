Hymn #356 - The Day of Resurrection
Tune: LANCASHIRE
File: elh356.txt

[1] The day of resurrection,
    Earth, tell it out abroad,
    The Passover of gladness,
    The Passover of God.
    From death to life eternal,
    From this world to the sky,
    Our Christ has brought us over
    With hymns of victory.

[2] Our hearts be purged of evil
    That we may see aright
    The Lord in rays eternal
    Of resurrection light
    And, list'ning to His accents,
    May hear, so calm and plain,
    His own "All hail!" and, hearing,
    May raise the victor strain.

[3] Now let the heav'ns be joyful,
    Let earth her song begin.
    Let all the world keep triumph
    And all that is therein.
    Let all things, seen and unseen,
    Their notes of gladness blend;
    For Christ the Lord has risen;
    Our joy shall have no end!
    Amen
