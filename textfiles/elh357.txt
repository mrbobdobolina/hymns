Tune: VICTORY
File: elh357.txt

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[1] The strife is o'er, the battle done;
    The victory of life is won;
    The song of triumph hath begun.
    Alleluia!

[2] The pow'rs of death have done their worst,
    But Christ their legions hath dispersed.
    Let shouts of holy joy outburst.
    Alleluia!

[3] The three sad days have quickly sped,
    He rises glorious from the dead.
    All glory to our risen Head!
    Alleluia!

[4] He closed the yawning gates of hell;
    The bars from heav'n's high portals fell.
    Let hymns of praise His triumph tell.
    Alleluia!

[5] Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee,
    From death's dread sting Thy servants free
    That we may live and sing to Thee.
    Alleluia!

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Amen
