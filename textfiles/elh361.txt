Hymn #361 - Faith Is a Living Power from Heaven
Tune: HERR JESU CHRIST, MEINS
File: elh361.txt

[1] Faith is a living pow'r from heav'n
    That grasps the promise God has giv'n,
    A trust that cannot be o'erthrown,
    Fixed heartily on Christ alone.

[2] Faith finds in Christ whate'er we need
    To save or strengthen us indeed,
    Receives the grace He sends us down,
    And makes us share His cross and crown.

[3] Faith in the conscience worketh peace
    And bids the mourner's weeping cease;
    By faith the children's place we claim
    And give all honor to one Name.

[4] Faith feels the Spirit's kindling breath
    In love and hope that conquer death;
    Faith worketh hourly joy in God
    And trusts and blesses e'en the rod.

[5] We thank Thee, then, O God of heav'n,
    That Thou to us this faith hast giv'n
    In Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who is
    Our only fount and source of bliss.

[6] And from His fullness grant each soul
    Its rightful faith's true end and goal:
    The blessedness no foes destroy,
    Eternal love, and light, and joy.
    Amen
