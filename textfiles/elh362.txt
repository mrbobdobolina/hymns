Hymn #362 - Jesus I Will Never Leave
Tune: MEINEN JESUM LASS ICH NICHT
File: elh362.txt

[1] Jesus I will never leave,
    Who for me Himself hath given;
    Firmly unto Him I'll cleave,
    Nor from Him be ever driven.
    Life from Him doth light receive--
    Jesus I will never leave.

[2] Jesus I will never leave
    While on earth I am abiding;
    What I have to Him I give,
    In all cares in Him confiding.
    Naught shall me of Him bereave--
    Jesus I will never leave.

[3] Though my sight shall pass away,
    Hearing, taste, and feeling fail me;
    Though my life's last light of day
    Shall o'ertake and sore assail me;
    When His summons I receive,
    Jesus I will never leave.

[4] Nor will I my Jesus leave
    When at last I shall come thither
    Where His saints He will receive,
    Where in bliss they live together.
    Endless joy to me He'll give--
    Jesus I will never leave.

[5] Not for earth's vain joys I crave
    Nor, without Him, heaven's pleasure;
    Jesus, who my soul did save,
    Evermore shall be my Treasure.
    He redemption did achieve--
    Jesus I will never leave.
    Amen
