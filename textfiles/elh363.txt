Hymn #363 - Thou Art the Way
Tune: DUNDEE
File: elh363.txt

[1] Thou art the Way; to Thee alone
    From sin and death we flee;
    And he who would the Father seek
    Must seek Him, Lord, by Thee.

[2] Thou art the Truth; Thy Word alone
    True wisdom can impart.
    Thou only can inform the mind
    And purify the heart.

[3] Thou art the Life; the rending tomb
    Proclaims Thy conqu'ring arm;
    And those who put their trust in Thee
    Not death nor hell shall harm.

[4] Thou art the Way, the Truth, the Life;
    Grant us that Way to know,
    That Truth to keep, that Life to win,
    Whose joys eternal flow.
    Amen
