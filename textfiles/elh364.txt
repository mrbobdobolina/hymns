Hymn #364 - O for a Faith That Will Not Shrink
Tune: WOLVERHAMPTON
File: elh364.txt

[1] O for a faith that will not shrink,
    Though pressed by many a foe,
    That will not tremble on the brink
    Of any earthly woe,

[2] That will not murmur nor complain
    Beneath the chast'ning rod,
    But in the hour of grief or pain
    Will lean upon its God,

[3] A faith that shines more bright and clear
    When tempests rage without,
    That, when in danger, knows no fear,
    In darkness feels no doubt,

[4] That bears unmoved the world's dread frown,
    Nor heeds its scornful smile,
    That seas of trouble cannot drown
    Nor Satan's arts beguile,

[5] A faith that keeps the narrow way
    Till life's last spark is fled
    And with a pure and heav'nly ray
    Lights up the dying bed.

[6] Lord, give us such a faith as this;
    And then, whate'er may come,
    We'll taste e'en here the hallowed bliss
    Of an eternal home.
    Amen
