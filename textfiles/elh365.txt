Hymn #365 - O Sing with Exultation
Tune: THOMISSON
File: elh365.txt

[1] O sing with exultation,
    Sing to the Lord, rejoice!
    And in His congregation
    Shout with triumphant voice!
    For, lo, at God's right hand
    Is Christ in glory seated;
    With death and hell defeated,
    As victor He doth stand.

[2] Since Christ, our Lord, is living,
    We never more shall die;
    To God the glory giving,
    We rise to Him on high;
    Though chastened we may be,
    And to our graves be taken,
    We unto life shall waken
    And live eternally.

[3] Christ is the sure foundation
    The builders did reject,
    But He for our salvation
    Is precious and elect
    And made the cornerstone
    On which the Church is founded;
    This marvel now is sounded,
    The work of God alone.

[4] To Thee, O Christ, be glory,
    Who camest in His name!
    Thy people sing the story
    Thy praises to proclaim;
    We thank Thee and adore,
    O Christ, our Lord and Savior;
    Thy grace and boundless favor
    Stand fast forevermore.
    Amen
