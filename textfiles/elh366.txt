File: elh366.txt

[1] Ye sons and daughters of the King,
    Whom heav'nly hosts in glory sing,
    Today the grave hath lost its sting!

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[2] On that first morning of the week,
    Before the day began to break,
    The Marys went their Lord to seek.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[3] An angel bade their sorrow flee,
    For thus he spake unto the three:
    "Your Lord doth go to Galilee."

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[4] That night th' Apostles met in fear;
    Amidst them came their Lord most dear
    And said: "Peace be unto you here."

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[5] When Thomas afterwards had heard
    That Jesus had fulfilled His word,
    He doubted if it were the Lord.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[6] "Thomas, behold My side," saith He,
    "My hands, My feet, My body, see;
    And doubt not, but believe in Me."

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[7] No longer Thomas then denied;
    He saw the feet, the hands, the side;
    "Thou art my Lord and God," he cried.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[8] Blessed are they who have not seen
    And yet whose faith hath constant been,
    In life eternal they shall reign.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[9] On this most holy day of days
    To God your hearts and voices raise
    In laud and jubilee and praise.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[10] And we with holy Church, unite,
     As evermore is just and right,
     In glory to the King of light.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Amen
