Tune: HER VIL TIES
File: elh367.txt

[1] Gracious Savior, gentle Shepherd,
    Children all are dear to Thee;
    Gathered with Thine arms, and carried
    In Thy bosom may we be;
    Sweetly, fondly, safely, tended,
    From all want and danger free.

[2] Tender Shepherd, never leave us
    From Thy fold to go astray;
    By Thy look of love directed,
    May we walk the narrow way.
    Thus direct us, and protect us,
    Lest they fall an easy prey.

[3] Cleanse our hearts from sinful folly
    In the stream Thy love supplied,
    Mingled stream of blood and water
    Flowing from Thy wounded side;
    And to heav'nly pastures lead us,
    Where Thine own still waters glide.

[4] Let Thy holy Word instruct us;
    Guide us daily by its light;
    Let Thy love and grace constrain us
    To approve whate'er is right,
    Take Thine easy yoke and wear it,
    Strengthened with Thy heav'nly might.

[5] Taught to lisp the holy praises
    Which on earth Thy children sing,
    Both with lips and hearts unfeigned,
    May we our thank-off'rings bring,
    Then with all the saints in glory
    Join to praise our Lord and King.
    Amen
