Hymn #368 - The Lord My Faithful Shepherd Is
Tune: ES IST GEWISSLICH
File: elh368.txt

[1] The Lord my faithful Shepherd is,
    And me He safely guideth;
    I shall not want for I am His
    Who all things good provideth.
    I follow Him, I hear His voice,
    In Him my Lord I do rejoice--
    Blest am I in His keeping!

[2] A tender shepherd leads his sheep
    Where pastures green are growing,
    And there His flock doth guard and keep
    Beside still waters flowing.
    Thus Christ, my Shepherd, leadeth me,
    My soul and body feedeth He
    And for their want provideth.

[3] And if I ever go astray,
    My wayward soul He turneth,
    To save the lost, to guide the way,
    For this He ever yearneth;
    He leadeth me, my soul to bless
    In His own path of righteousness
    For His name's sake and glory.

[4] Why should I ever fear, O Lord,
    Whilst Thee I have beside me?
    Thou by Thy Spirit and Thy Word
    Dost comfort and dost guide me.
    In death's dark vale I'll fear no ill,
    For Thou, O Lord, art with me still,
    Thy rod and staff shall stay me.

[5] Thou art my host; for me, Thy guest,
    A table Thou providest.
    Though foes be near, I am at rest,
    Thou still with me abidest.
    With oil anointest Thou my head,
    On me Thy blessing rich is shed,
    My cup with bliss o'erfloweth.

[6] Thy goodness and Thy mercy, Lord,
    Shall follow me, attending
    The days Thou dost to me afford
    Until they reach their ending.
    Thereafter shall I in Thy love
    Dwell in Thy house in heav'n above
    Forever and forever.
    Amen
