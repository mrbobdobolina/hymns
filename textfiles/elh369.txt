Hymn #369 - O Bless the Lord, My Soul
Tune: ST. THOMAS
File: elh369.txt

[1] O bless the Lord, my soul,
    His grace to Thee proclaim,
    And all that is within me join
    To bless His Holy name.

[2] O bless the Lord, my soul;
    His mercies bear in mind;
    Forget not all His benefits:
    The Lord to thee is kind.

[3] He will not always chide;
    He will with patience wait;
    His wrath is ever slow to rise,
    And ready to abate.

[4] He pardons all thy sins;
    Prolongs thy feeble breath;
    He heals all thine infirmities,
    And ransoms thee from death.

[5] He clothes thee with His love;
    Upholds thee with His truth;
    And like the eagle He renews
    The vigor of thy youth.

[6] Then bless His holy name,
    Whose grace hath made thee whole,
    Whose loving kindness crowns thy days:
    O bless the Lord, my soul!
    Amen
