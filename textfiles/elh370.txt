Hymn #370 - The King of Love My Shepherd Is
Tune: ST. COLUMBA
File: elh370.txt

[1] The King of love my Shepherd is,
    Whose goodness faileth never;
    I nothing lack if I am His,
    And He is mine forever.

[2] Where streams of living water flow,
    My ransomed soul He leadeth,
    And where the verdant pastures grow,
    With food celestial feedeth.

[3] Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
    But yet in love He sought me
    And on His shoulder gently laid
    And home, rejoicing, brought me.

[4] In death's dark vale I fear no ill
    With Thee, dear Lord, beside me;
    Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
    Thy cross before to guide me.

[5] Thou spread a table in my sight,
    Thy unction grace bestoweth;
    And O what transport of delight
    From Thy pure chalice floweth!

[6] And so through all the length of days
    Thy goodness faileth never.
    Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
    Within Thy house forever.
    Amen
