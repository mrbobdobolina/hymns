Hymn #371 - The Lord's My Shepherd, I'll Not Want
Tune: BELMONT
File: elh371.txt

[1] The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want;
    He makes me down to lie
    In pastures green; He leadeth me
    The quiet waters by.

[2] My soul He doth restore again
    And me to walk doth make
    Within the paths of righteousness,
    E'en for His own name's sake.

[3] Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
    Yet will I fear no ill;
    For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
    And staff me comfort still.

[4] My table Thou hast furnished
    In presence of my foes;
    My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
    And my cup overflows.

[5] Goodness and mercy, all my life,
    Shall surely follow me;
    And in God's house forevermore
    My dwelling place shall be.
    Amen
