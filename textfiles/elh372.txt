Tune: SURREY
File: elh372.txt

[1] Jesus, Thy boundless love to me
    No thought can reach, no tongue declare;
    Unite my thankful heart with Thee
    And reign without a rival there.
    To Thee alone, dear Lord, I live;
    Myself to Thee, dear Lord, I give.

[2] O grant that nothing in my soul
    May dwell but Thy pure love alone!
    O may Thy love possess me whole,
    My Joy, my Treasure, and my Crown!
    All coldness from my heart remove;
    My ev'ry act, word, thought, be love.

[3] O Love, how cheering is Thy ray!
    All pain before Thy presence flies;
    Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away
    Where'er Thy healing beams arise.
    O Jesus, nothing may I see,
    Nothing desire or seek, but Thee!

[4] This love unwearied I pursue
    And dauntlessly to Thee aspire.
    O may Thy love my hope renew,
    Burn in my soul like heav'nly fire!
    And day and night be all my care
    To guard this sacred treasure there.

[5] O draw me, Savior, e'er to Thee;
    So shall I run and never tire.
    With gracious words still comfort me;
    Be Thou my Hope, my sole Desire.
    Free me from ev'ry guilt and fear;
    No sin can harm if Thou art near.

[6] Still let Thy love point out my way;
    What wondrous things Thy love hath wrought!
    Still lead me lest I go astray;
    Direct my work, inspire my thought;
    And if I fall, soon may I hear
    Thy voice and know that love is near!

[7] In suff'ring be Thy love my peace;
    In weakness be Thy love my pow'r;
    And when the storms of life shall cease,
    O Jesus, in that final hour,
    Be Thou my Rod and Staff and Guide
    And draw me safely to Thy side.
    Amen
