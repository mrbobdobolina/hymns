Hymn #373 - I Know That My Redeemer
Tune: JEG VIL MIG HERREN LOVE
File: elh373.txt

[1] I know that my Redeemer
    Live crowned upon the throne;
    Lord over earth and heaven,
    He saves, and He alone;
    He conquered death by dying
    Upon th' accursed tree,
    And from His death sprang glorious
    Eternal life for me.

[2] Christ conquered death by dying--
    O Jesus, Thy dread pain
    O'erthrew the king of terrors
    And broke the captive's chain.
    What though this earthly body
    Obey death's dread behest?
    The soul soars free rejoicing
    To mansions of the blest.

[3] I think upon my Savior,
    I trust His pow'r to keep,
    His mighty arm enfolds me
    Awaking and in sleep.
    Christ is my Rock, my Courage;
    Christ is my soul's true Life;
    And Christ--my still heart knows it--
    Will bear me through the strife.

[4] Thus in Christ's name I'm living,
    Thus in Christ's name I'll die;
    I'll fear not, though life's vigor
    From death's cold shadow fly.
    O grave, where is thy triumph?
    O death, where is thy sting?
    "Come when thou wilt, and welcome!"
    Secure in Christ I sing.
    Amen
