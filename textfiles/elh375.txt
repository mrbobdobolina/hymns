Hymn #375 - O Little Flock, Fear Not the Foe
Tune: KOMMT HER ZU MIR
File: elh375.txt

[1] O little flock, fear not the foe
    Who madly seeks your overthrow;
    Dread not his rage and pow'r.
    What though your courage sometimes faints,
    His seeming triumph o'er God's saints
    Lasts but a little hour.

[2] Be of good cheer; your cause belongs
    To Him who can avenge your wrongs;
    Leave it to Him, our Lord.
    Though hidden yet from mortal eyes,
    His Gideon shall for you arise,
    Uphold you and His Word.

[3] As true as God's own Word is true,
    Not earth nor hell with all their crew
    Against us shall prevail.
    A jest and byword are they grown;
    God is with us, we are His own;
    Our vict'ry cannot fail.

[4] Amen, Lord Jesus, grant our prayer;
    Great Captain, now Thine arm make bare,
    Fight for us once again!
    So shall Thy saints and martyrs raise
    A mighty chorus to Thy praise,
    World without end. Amen.
    Amen
