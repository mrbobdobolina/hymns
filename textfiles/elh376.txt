File: elh376.txt

[1] Rejoice, the Lord is King!
    Your Lord and King adore;
    Mortals, give thanks, and sing,
    And triumph evermore:

[Refrain] Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
          Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice!

[2] Jesus, the Savior, reigns,
    The God of truth and love;
    When He had purged our stains,
    He took His seat above:

[Refrain] Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
          Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice!

[3] His kingdom cannot fail;
    He rules o'er earth and heav'n;
    The keys of death and hell
    Are to our Jesus giv'n:

[Refrain] Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
          Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice!

[4] He sits at God's right hand
    Till all his foes submit
    And bow to His command
    And fall beneath His feet:

[Refrain] Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
          Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice!

[5] He all His foes shall quell,
    Shall all our sins destroy;
    And ev'ry bosom swell
    With pure seraphic voice;

[Refrain] Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
          Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice!

[6] He all His foes shall quell,
    Shall all our sins destroy;
    And ev'ry bosom swell
    With pure seraphic voice;

[Refrain] Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
          Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice!
          Amen
