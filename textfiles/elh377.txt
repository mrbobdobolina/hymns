Hymn #377 - Why Should Cross and Trial Grieve Me
Tune: WARUM SOLLT ICH MICH DENN GRAMEN
File: elh377.txt

[1] Why should cross and trial grieve me?
    Christ is near With His cheer;
    Never will He leave me.
    Who can rob me of the heaven
    That God's Son For my own
    To my faith hath given?

[2] Though a heavy cross I'm bearing
    And my heart Feels the smart,
    Shall I be despairing?
    God, my Helper, who doth send it,
    Well doth know All my woe
    And how best to end it.

[3] God oft gives me days of gladness;
    Shall I grieve If He give
    Seasons, too, of sadness?
    God is good and tempers ever
    All my ill, And He will
    Wholly leave me never.

[4] Hopeful, cheerful, and undaunted
    Ev'rywhere They appear
    Who in Christ are planted.
    Death itself cannot appal them,
    They rejoice When the voice
    Of their Lord doth call them.

[5] Death cannot destroy forever;
    From our fears, Cares, and tears
    It will us deliver.
    It will close life's mournful story,
    Make a way That we may
    Enter heav'nly glory.

[6] What is all this life possesses?
    But a hand Full of sand
    That the heart distresses.
    Noble gifts that pall me never
    Christ, our Lord, Will accord
    To His saints forever.

[7] Lord, my Shepherd, take me to Thee.
    Thou art mine; I was Thine,
    Even e'er I knew Thee.
    I am Thine, for Thou hast bought me;
    Lost I stood, But Thy blood
    Free salvation brought me.

[8] Thou art mine; I love and own Thee.
    Light of Joy, Ne'er shall I
    From my heart dethrone Thee.
    Savior, let me soon behold Thee
    Face to face; May Thy grace
    Evermore enfold me!
    Amen
