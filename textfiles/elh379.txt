Tune: JESUS, JESUS, NICHTS ALS JESUS
File: elh379.txt

[1] Jesus, Jesus, only Jesus
    Can my heartfelt longing still.
    Lo, I pledge myself to Jesus,
    What He wills alone to will.
    For my heart, which He hath filled,
    Ever cries, "Lord, as Thou wilt."

[2] One there is for whom I'm living,
    Whom I love most tenderly;
    Unto Jesus I am giving
    What in love He gave to me.
    Jesus' blood hides all my guilt--
    Lord, O lead me as Thou wilt.

[3] What to me may seem a treasure
    But displeasing is to Thee--
    O remove such harmful pleasure;
    Give instead what profits me.
    Let my heart by Thee be stilled;
    Make me Thine, Lord, as Thou wilt.

[4] Let me earnestly endeavor
    Thy good pleasure to fulfill;
    In me, through me, with me ever,
    Lord, accomplish Thou Thy will.
    In Thy holy image built,
    Let me die, Lord, as Thou wilt.

[5] Jesus, constant be my praises,
    For Thou unto me didst bring
    Thine own self and all Thy graces
    That I joyfully may sing:
    Be it unto me, my Shield,
    As Thou wilt, Lord, as Thou wilt.
    Amen
