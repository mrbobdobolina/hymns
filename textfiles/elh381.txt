Hymn #381 - Come, My Soul, with All Thy Care
Tune: VIENNA
File: elh381.txt

[1] Come, my soul, with all thy care;
    Jesus loves to answer prayer,
    He Himself has bid thee pray,
    Therefore will not say thee nay.

[2] Thou art coming to a king--
    Large petitions with thee bring,
    For His grace and pow'r are such,
    None can ever ask too much.

[3] With my burden I begin:
    Lord, remove this load of sin;
    Let Thy blood, for sinners spilt,
    Set my conscience free from guilt.

[4] God, my Lord, my King, Thou art;
    Enter now my faithful heart.
    There Thy blood-bought right maintain
    And without a rival reign.

[5] While I am a pilgrim here,
    Let Thy love my spirit cheer.
    Be my Guide, my Guard, my Friend,
    Lead me to my journey's end.

[6] Ev'ry hour my strength renew
    By Thy Word and Spirit true.
    Let me live a life of faith;
    Let me die Thy people's death.
    Amen
