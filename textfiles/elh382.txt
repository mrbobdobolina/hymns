Hymn #382 - Lord, Teach Us how to Pray Aright
Tune: DOMINE, CLAMAVI
File: elh382.txt

[1] Lord, teach us how to pray aright,
    With rev'rence and with fear;
    Though dust and ashes in Thy sight,
    We may, we must draw near.

[2] Burdened with guilt, convinced of sin,
    In weakness, want, and woe,
    False hopes without and fears within,
    Lord, whither shall we go?

[3] God of all grace, we come to Thee
    With broken, contrite hearts;
    Give what Thine eye delights to see,
    Truth in the inward parts.

[4] Give deep humility; the sense
    Of godly sorrow give;
    A strong desire, with confidence,
    To hear Thy voice and live;

[5] Faith in the only sacrifice
    That can for sin atone,
    To cast our hopes, to fix our eyes,
    On Christ, on Christ alone.

[6] Give these, and then Thy will be done;
    Thus strengthened with all might,
    We, through Thy Spirit and Thy Son,
    Shall pray, and pray aright.
    Amen
