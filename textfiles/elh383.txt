Tune: VATER UNSER
File: elh383.txt

[1] Our Father, Thou in heav'n above,
    Who biddest us to dwell in love
    As brethren of one family
    And cry for all we need to Thee;
    Teach us to mean the words we say,
    And from the inmost heart to pray.

[2] All hallowed be Thy name, O Lord!
    O let us firmly keep Thy word,
    And lead, according to Thy name,
    A holy life, untouched by blame;
    Let no false teachings do us hurt;
    All poor, deluded souls convert.

[3] Thy kingdom come! Thine let it be
    In time and through eternity!
    O let Thy Holy Spirit dwell
    With us, to rule and guide us well;
    From Satan's mighty pow'r and rage
    Preserve Thy Church from age to age.

[4] Thy will be done on earth, O Lord,
    As where in heav'n Thou art adored!
    Patience in time of grief bestow,
    Obedience true in weal and woe;
    Our sinful flesh and blood control
    That thwart Thy will within the soul.

[5] Give us this day our daily bread,
    Let us be duly clothed and fed;
    And keep Thou from our homes afar
    Famine and pestilence and war,
    That we may live in godly peace
    Unvexed by cares and avarice.

[6] Forgive our sins, that they no more
    May grieve and haunt us as before,
    As we forgive their trespasses
    Who unto us have done amiss;
    Thus let us dwell in charity
    And serve each other willingly.

[7] Into temptation lead us not,
    And when the foe doth war and plot
    Against our souls on ev'ry hand,
    Then armed with faith, O may we stand
    Against him as a valiant host
    Through comfort of the Holy Ghost.

[8] Deliv'rance from all evil give,
    For yet in evil days we live.
    Redeem us from eternal death,
    And, when we yield our dying breath,
    Console us, grant us calm release,
    And take our souls to Thee in peace.

[9] Amen! That is, so let it be!
    Strengthen our faith and trust in Thee
    That we may doubt not, but believe
    That what we ask we shall receive.
    Thus in Thy name and at Thy word
    We say: "Amen. Now hear us, Lord."
    Amen
