Hymn #384 - Our Father, Throned in Heaven Above
Tune: TALLIS' CANON
File: elh384.txt

[1] Our Father, throned in heav'n above,
    All glory to Thy name of love.
    Thy Kingdom come; Thy holy will
    May earth as well as heav'n fulfill.

[2] Give us this day our daily food
    With all we need of promised good;
    And freely all our sins remit
    As we our debtors freely quit.

[3] Defend us from the tempter's ways,
    Uphold when tried, when fallen raise:
    For pow'r is Thine, and boundless reign,
    In glory evermore, Amen.
    Amen
