Hymn #385 - What a Friend We Have in Jesus
Tune: BETHANY
File: elh385.txt

[1] What a friend we have in Jesus,
    All our sins and griefs to bear!
    What a privilege to carry
    Ev'rything to God in prayer!
    O what peace we often forfeit;
    O what needless pain we bear--
    All because we do not carry
    Ev'rything to God in prayer!

[2] Have we trials and temptations?
    Is there trouble anywhere?
    We should never be discouraged--
    Take it to the Lord in prayer!
    Can we find a Friend so faithful
    Who will all our sorrows share?
    Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness--
    Take it to the Lord in prayer.

[3] Are we weak and heavy laden,
    Cumbered with a load of care?
    Precious Savior, still our refuge--
    Take it to the Lord in prayer.
    Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
    Take it to the Lord in prayer.
    In His arms He'll take and shield thee;
    Thou wilt find a solace there.
    Amen
