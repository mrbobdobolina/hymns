Tune: HER KOMMER DINE, ARME SMAA
File: elh386.txt

[1] Lord God, who art my Father dear,
    I pray in Jesus' name: O hear
    What, trusting in His promised Word,
    I humbly ask of Thee, good Lord.

[2] Grant us Thy Word, Thy Spirit give,
    That by His grace we godly live;
    Give shelter, peace, good friends, and food,
    Protect our native land, O God.

[3] Save us from sin and Satan's fraud,
    Deliver us from evil, God,
    Be with us in our dying hour;
    Thine is the kingdom, glory, pow'r.

[4] Lord, at Thy word, Amen I say;
    Increase my feeble faith, I pray.
    Thou lead'st me with a Father's care;
    O let me be Thy child and heir!
    Amen
