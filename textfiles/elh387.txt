Hymn #387 - Prayer Is The Soul's Sincere Desire
Tune: LUTHER SEMINARY
File: elh387.txt

[1] Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
    Unuttered or expressed;
    The motion of a hidden fire
    That trembles in the breast.

[2] Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
    The falling of a tear,
    The upward glancing of the eye,
    When none but God is near.

[3] Prayer is the simplest form of speech
    That infant lips can try;
    Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
    The Majesty on high.

[4] Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
    The Christian's native air;
    His watchword at the gates of death:
    He enters heav'n with prayer.

[5] Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice
    Returning from his ways
    While angels in their songs rejoice,
    And cry, "Behold, he prays!"

[6] O Thou, by whom we come to God,
    The Life, the Truth, the Way!
    The path of prayer Thyself hast trod;
    Lord, teach us how to pray.
    Amen
