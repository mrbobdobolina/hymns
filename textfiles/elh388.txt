Hymn #388 - Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise
Tune: ORIENTIS PARTIBUS
File: elh388.txt

[1] Hail the day that sees Him rise
    To His throne above the skies!
    Christ, the Lamb for sinners giv'n,
    Reascends His native heav'n.

[2] There the glorious triumph waits:
    Lift your heads, eternal gates.
    He hath conquered death and sin;
    Take the King of glory in!

[3] See, the heav'n its Lord receives,
    Yet He loves the earth He leaves;
    Though returning to His throne,
    Still He calls mankind His own.

[4] See, He lifts His hands above;
    See, He shows the prints of love.
    Hark! His gracious lips bestow
    Blessings on His Church below.

[5] Still for us He intercedes,
    His prevailing death He pleads,
    Near Himself prepares our place,
    Harbinger of human race.

[6] There we shall with Thee remain
    Partners in Thy endless reign,
    There Thy face unclouded see,
    Find our heav'n of heav'ns in Thee.
    Amen
