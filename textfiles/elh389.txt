File: elh389.txt

[1] A hymn of glory let us sing!
    New songs throughout the world shall ring:
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    Christ, by a road before untrod,
    Ascendeth to the throne of God.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[2] The holy apostolic band
    Upon the Mount of Olives stand.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    And with His followers they see
    Jesus' resplendent majesty.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[3] To whom the angels, drawing nigh,
    "Why stand and gaze upon the sky?
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    This is the Savior," thus they say,
    "This is His noble triumph day."

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[4] "Again shall ye behold Him so
    As ye today have seen Him go,
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    "In glorious pomp ascending high
    Up to the portals of the sky."

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[5] O grant us thitherward to tend
    And with unwearied hearts ascend,
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    Unto Thy kingdom's throne, where Thou,
    As is our faith, art seated now.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[6] Be Thou our Joy and strong Defense,
    Who art our future Recompense:
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    So shall the light that springs from Thee
    Be ours through all eternity.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[7] O risen Christ, ascended Lord,
    All praise to Thee let earth accord,
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    Who art, while endless ages run,
    With Father and with Spirit One.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Amen
