Hymn #391 - Lo, God to Heaven Ascendeth
Tune: AUS MEINES HERZENS GRUNDE
File: elh391.txt

[1] Lo, God to heav'n ascendeth!
    Great joy doth there abound;
    With shouts triumphant blendeth
    The trumpet's thrilling sound.
    Sing praise to Christ the Lord;
    Sing praise with exultation,
    King of each heathen nation,
    The God of hosts adored!

[2] With joy is heav'n resounding
    Christ's glad return to see;
    Behold the saints surrounding
    The Lord who set them free.
    Bright myriads, thronging, come;
    The cherub band rejoices,
    And loud seraphic voices
    All welcome Jesus home.

[3] No more the way is hidden,
    Since Christ, our Head, arose:
    No more to man forbidden,
    The road to heav'n that goes;
    Our Lord is gone before,
    Yet here He will not leave us,
    But soon in heav'n receive us:
    He opens wide the door.

[4] Christ is our place preparing.
    To heav'n we, too, shall rise,
    And, joys angelic sharing,
    Be where our treasure lies:
    There may each heart be found,
    Where Jesus Christ has entered!
    There let our hopes be centered,
    Our course still heav'nward bound!

[5] May we, His servants, thither
    In heart and mind ascend;
    And let us sing together.
    We seek Thee, Christ, our Friend--
    Thee, God's anointed Son--
    Our life, and way to heaven,
    To whom all pow'r is given,
    Our joy, and hope, and crown.
    Amen
