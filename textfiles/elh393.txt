Hymn #393 - The Head That Once Was Crowned
Tune: ST. MAGNUS
File: elh393.txt

[1] The Head that once was crowned with thorns
    Is crowned with glory now;
    A royal diadem adorns
    The mighty Victor's brow.

[2] The highest place that heav'n affords
    Is His, is His by right,
    The King of kings, and Lord of lords,
    And heav'n's eternal Light;

[3] The Joy of all who dwell above,
    The Joy of all below,
    To whom He manifests His love
    And grants His name to know.

[4] To them the cross with all its shame,
    With all its grace, is giv'n;
    Their name, an everlasting name;
    Their joy, the joy of heav'n.

[5] They suffer with their Lord below,
    They reign with Him above,
    Their profit and their joy to know
    The myst'ry of His love.

[6] The cross He bore is life and health,
    Though shame and death to Him;
    His people's hope, His people's wealth,
    Their everlasting theme.
    Amen
