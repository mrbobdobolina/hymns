Tune: ERSCHIENEN IST DER HERRLICH TAG
File: elh394.txt

[1] We thank Thee, Jesus, dearest Friend,
    That Thou didst into heav'n ascend.
    O blessed Savior, bid us live
    And strength to soul and body give.
    Alleluia.

[2] Ascended to His throne on high,
    Hid from our sight, yet always nigh,
    He rules and reigns at God's right hand
    And has all pow'r at His command.
    Alleluia.

[3] The man who trusts in Him is blest
    And finds in Him eternal rest;
    This world's allurements we despise
    And fix on Christ alone our eyes.
    Alleluia.

[4] We therefore heartily rejoice
    And sing His praise with cheerful voice;
    He captive led captivity,
    From bitter death He set us free.
    Alleluia.

[5] Through Him we heirs of heav'n are made;
    O Brother, Christ, extend Thine aid
    That we may firmly trust in Thee
    And through Thee live eternally.
    Alleluia.
    Amen
