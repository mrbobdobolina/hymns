Hymn #395 - Awake, Thou Spirit, Who Didst Fire
Tune: ST. CATHERINE
File: elh395.txt

[1] Awake, Thou Spirit, who didst fire
    The watchmen of the Church's youth,
    Who faced the foe's envenomed ire,
    Who witnessed day and night Thy truth,
    Whose voices loud are ringing still
    And bringing hosts to know Thy will.

[2] Lord, let our earnest pray'r be heard,
    The pray'r Thy Son hath bid us pray;
    For lo, Thy children's hearts are stirred
    In ev'ry land in this our day,
    To cry with fervent soul to Thee,
    "O help us, Lord! so let it be!"

[3] O haste to help, ere we are lost!
    Send preachers forth in spirit strong,
    Armed with Thy Word, a dauntless host,
    Bold to attack the rule of wrong.
    Let them the earth for Thee reclaim,
    The heritage, to know Thy name.

[4] And let Thy Word have speedy course,
    Through ev'ry land be glorified
    Till all the heathen know its force
    And fill Thy churches far and wide.
    Wake Israel from his sleep, O Lord,
    And spread the conquest of Thy Word!

[5] The Church's desert path restore;
    Let stumbling-blocks that in them lie
    Hinder Thy Word henceforth no more:
    Error destroy, and heresy,
    And let Thy Church, from hirelings free,
    Bloom as a garden fair to Thee!
    Amen
