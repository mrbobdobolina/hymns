Hymn #396 - If God Had Not Been on Our Side
Tune: WAR GOTT NICHT MIT UNS
File: elh396.txt

[1] If God had not been on our side
    And had not come to aid us,
    The foes with all their pow'r and pride
    Would surely have dismayed us,
    For we, His flock, would have to fear
    The threat of men both far and near
    Who rise in might against us.

[2] Their furious wrath, did God permit,
    Would surely have consumed us
    And as a deep and yawning pit
    With life and limb entombed us.
    Like men o'er whom dark waters roll
    Their wrath would have engulfed our soul
    And, like a flood, o'erwhelmed us.

[3] Blest be the Lord, who foiled their threat
    That they could not devour us.
    Our souls, like birds, escaped their net;
    They could not overpow'r us.
    The snare is broken, we are free!
    Our help is ever, Lord in Thee,
    Who madest earth and heaven.
    Amen
