Tune: LOBT GOTT, IHR CHRISTEN
File: elh397.txt

[1] O Christ, our hope, our hearts' desire,
    Redemption's only spring!
    Creator of the world art Thou,
    Its Savior and its King,
    Its Savior and its King.

[2] How vast the mercy and the love
    Which laid our sins on Thee,
    And led Thee to a cruel death
    To set Thy people free,
    To set Thy people free!

[3] But now the bands of death are burst,
    The ransom has been paid!
    And Thou art on Thy Father's throne,
    In glorious robes arrayed,
    In glorious robes arrayed.

[4] O may Thy mighty love prevail
    Our sinful souls to spare!
    O may we come before Thy throne
    And find acceptance there,
    And find acceptance there!

[5] O Christ, be Thou our present joy,
    Our future great reward;
    Our only glory may it be
    To glory in the Lord,
    To glory in the Lord!
    Amen
