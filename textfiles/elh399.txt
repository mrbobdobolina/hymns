File: elh399.txt

[1] O Light of God's most wondrous love,
    Who dost our darkness brighten,
    Shed on Thy Church from heav'n above,
    Our eye of faith enlighten!
    As in Thy light we gather here,
    Show us that Christ's own promise clear
    Is Yea and Amen ever.
    O risen and ascended Lord,
    We wait fulfillment of Thy Word;
    O bless us with Thy favor!
    Amen
