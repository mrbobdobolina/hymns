Tune: VON GOTT WILL ICH NICHT
File: elh400.txt

[1] O enter, Lord, Thy temple,
    Be Thou my spirit's Guest,
    Who gavest me, the earth-born,
    A second birth more blest.
    Thou in the Godhead, Lord,
    Though here to dwell Thou deignest,
    Forever equal reignest,
    Art equally adored.

[2] Thou, Holy Spirit, teachest
    The soul to pray aright;
    Thy songs have sweetest music
    Thy prayers have wondrous might.
    Unheard they cannot fall,
    They pierce the highest heaven
    Till He His help hath given
    Who surely helpeth all.

[3] Thy gift is joy, O Spirit,
    Thou wouldst not have us pine;
    In darkest hours Thy comfort
    Doth ever brightly shine.
    And, O how oft Thy voice
    Hath shed it sweetness o'er me
    And opened heav'n before me
    And bid my heart rejoice!
    Amen
