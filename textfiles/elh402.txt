Hymn #402 - Holy Ghost, with Light Divine
Tune: SONG 13
File: elh402.txt

[1] Holy Ghost, with light divine
    Shine upon this heart of mine;
    Chase the shades of night away;
    Turn the darkness into day.

[2] Let me see my Savior's face,
    Let me all His beauties trace;
    Show those glorious truths to me
    Which are only known to Thee.

[3] Holy Ghost, with pow'r divine
    Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
    In Thy mercy pity me;
    From sin's bondage set me free.

[4] Holy Ghost, with joy divine
    Cheer this saddened heart of mine;
    Yield a sacred, settled peace;
    Let it grow and still increase.

[5] Holy Spirit, all divine,
    Dwell within this heart of mine;
    Cast down ev'ry idol throne,
    Reign supreme and reign alone.

[6] See, to Thee I yield my heart,
    Shed Thy life through ev'ry part;
    A pure temple I would be,
    Wholly dedicate to Thee.
    Amen
