Hymn #403 - God Loved the World So that He Gave
Tune: ST. CRISPIN
File: elh403.txt

[1] God loved the world so that He gave
    His only Son the lost to save,
    That all who would in Him believe
    Should everlasting life receive.

[2] Christ Jesus is the Ground of faith,
    Who was made flesh and suffered death;
    All then who trust in Him alone
    Are built on this chief Cornerstone.

[3] God would not have the sinner die,
    His Son with saving grace is nigh;
    His Spirit in the Word doth teach
    How man the blessed goal may reach.

[4] Be of good cheer, for God's own Son
    Forgives the sins that thou have done;
    And, justified by Jesus' blood,
    Thy Baptism grants the highest good.

[5] If thou be sick, if death draw near,
    This truth thy troubled heart can cheer:
    Christ Jesus saves my soul from death;
    This is the firmest ground of faith.

[6] Glory to God the Father, Son,
    And Holy Spirit, Three in One!
    To Thee, O blessed Trinity,
    Be praise now and eternally!
    Amen
