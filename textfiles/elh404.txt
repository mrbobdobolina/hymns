File: elh404.txt

[1] The Lord, my God, be praised,
    My Light, my Life from heaven;
    My Maker, who to me
    Hath soul and body given;
    My Father, who doth shield
    And keep me day by day,
    Doth make each moment yield
    New blessings on my way.

[2] The Lord, my God, be praised,
    My Trust, my Life from heaven,
    The Father's own dear Son,
    Whose life for me was given,
    Who for my sin atoned
    With His most precious blood,
    Who giveth me by faith
    The highest heav'nly good.

[3] The Lord, my God, be praised,
    My Hope, my Life from heaven,
    The Spirit, whom the Son
    In love to me hath given.
    'Tis He revives my heart,
    'Tis He that gives me pow'r,
    Help, comfort, and support
    In sorrow's gloomy hour.

[4] The Lord, my God, be praised,
    My God, who ever liveth,
    To whom the heav'nly host
    All praise and honor giveth.
    The Lord, my God, be praised,
    In whose great name I boast,
    God Father, God the Son,
    And God the Holy Ghost.

[5] To Him with joyful song
    Our praises we are bringing
    And with the angel throng
    Thrice "Holy" we are singing.
    With one united voice
    The Church doth Him adore.
    The Lord, my God, be praised
    Now and forevermore.
    Amen
