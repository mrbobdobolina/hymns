File: elh406.txt

[1] Lord, Thee I love with all my heart;
    I pray Thee ne'er from me depart,
    With tender mercy cheer me.
    Earth has no pleasure I would share,
    Yea, heav'n itself were void and bare
    If Thou, Lord, wert not near me.
    And should my heart for sorrow break,
    My trust in Thee no one could shake.
    Thou art the Portion I have sought;
    Thy precious blood my soul has bought.
    Lord Jesus Christ,
    My God and Lord, my God and Lord,
    Forsake me not! I trust Thy Word.

[2] Yea, Lord, 'twas Thy rich bounty gave
    My body, soul, and all I have
    In this poor life of labor.
    Lord, grant that I in ev'ry place
    May glorify Thy lavish grace
    And serve and help my neighbor.
    Let no false doctrine me beguile;
    Let Satan not my soul defile.
    Give strength and patience unto me
    To bear my cross and follow Thee.
    Lord Jesus Christ,
    My God and Lord, my God and Lord,
    In death Thy comfort still afford.

[3] Lord, let at last Thine angels come,
    To Abram's bosom bear me home,
    That I may die unfearing;
    And in its narrow chamber keep
    My body safe in peaceful sleep
    Until Thy reappearing.
    And then from death awaken me
    That these mine eyes with joy may see,
    O Son of God, Thy glorious face,
    My Savior and my Fount of grace,
    Lord Jesus Christ,
    My prayer attend, my prayer attend,
    And I will praise Thee without end.
    Amen
