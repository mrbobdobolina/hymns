Hymn #408 - Round the Lord in Glory Seated
Tune: EBENEZER (TON-Y-BOTEL)
File: elh408.txt

[1] Round the Lord in glory seated,
    Cherubim and seraphim
    Filled His temple, and repeated
    Each to each the mighty hymn:

[Refrain] "Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,
          Earth is with its fulness stored;
          Unto Thee be glory given,
          Holy, holy, holy, Lord!"

[2] Heav'n is still with glory ringing,
    Earth takes up the angels' cry,
    "Holy, holy, holy," singing,
    "Lord of Hosts, the Lord most high!"

[Refrain] "Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,
          Earth is with its fulness stored;
          Unto Thee be glory given,
          Holy, holy, holy, Lord!"

[3] With His seraph-train before Him
    With His holy Church below,
    Thus unite we to adore Him,
    Bid we thus our anthem flow:

[Refrain] "Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,
          Earth is with its fulness stored;
          Unto Thee be glory given,
          Holy, holy, holy, Lord!"
          Amen
