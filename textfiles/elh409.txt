Tune: ICH WILL DICH LIEBEN
File: elh409.txt

[1] Thee will I love, my strength, my Tower;
    Thee will I love, my Hope, my Joy.
    Thee will I love with all my power,
    With ardor time shall ne'er destroy.
    Thee will I love, O Light Divine,
    So long as life is mine.

[2] Thee will I love, my Life, my Savior,
    Who art my best and truest Friend.
    Thee will I love and praise forever,
    For never shall Thy kindness end.
    Thee will I love with all my heart--
    Thou my Redeemer art!

[3] I thank Thee, Jesus, Sun from heaven,
    Whose radiance hath brought light to me.
    I thank Thee, who hast richly given
    All that could make me glad and free.
    I thank Thee that my soul is healed
    By what Thy lips revealed.

[4] O keep me watchful, then, and humble;
    And suffer me no more to stray.
    Uphold me when my feet would stumble,
    Nor let me loiter by the way.
    Fill all my nature with Thy light,
    O Radiance strong and bright!

[5] O teach me, Lord, to love Thee truly
    With soul and body, head and heart,
    And grant me grace that I may duly
    Practice fore'er love's sacred art.
    Grant that my ev'ry thought may be
    Directed e'er to Thee.

[6] Thee will I love, my Crown of gladness,
    Thee will I love, my God and Lord,
    Amid the darkest depths of sadness,
    Not for the hope of high reward,
    For Thine own sake, O Light Divine,
    So long as life is mine.
    Amen
