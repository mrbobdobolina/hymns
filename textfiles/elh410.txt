File: elh410.txt

[1] Glory be to God the Father!
    Glory be to God the Son!
    Glory be to God the Spirit!
    God Eternal, Three in One!

[2] Glory be to Him who loved us,
    Washed us from each spot and stain!
    Glory be to Him who bought us,
    Made us kings with Him to reign!

[3] Glory to the King of angels!
    Glory to the Church's King!
    Glory to the King of nations!
    Heav'n and earth, your praises bring!

[4] Glory, blessing, praise eternal!
    Thus the choir of angels sings,
    Honor, riches, pow'r, dominion!
    Thus its praise creation brings.

[5] Glory be to God the Father!
    Glory be to God the Son!
    Glory be to God the Spirit!
    God Eternal, Three in One!
    Amen
