Hymn #411 - Christians, Come, in Sweetest Measures
Tune: ALLES IST AN GOTTES SEGEN
File: elh411.txt

[1] Christians, come, in sweetest measures
    Sing of those who spread the treasures
    In the holy Gospels shrined;
    Blessed tidings of salvation,
    Peace on earth their proclamation,
    Love from God to lost mankind.

[2] See the rivers four that gladden
    With their streams the better Eden,
    Planted by our Savior dear.
    Christ the Fountain, these the waters.
    Drink, O Zion's sons and daughters;
    Drink and find salvation here.

[3] Here our souls, be Jesus sated,
    More and more shall be translated
    Earth's temptations far above;
    Freed from sin's abhorred dominion,
    Soaring on angelic pinion,
    They shall reach the Source of love.

[4] Then shall thanks and praise ascending
    For Thy mercies without ending
    Rise to Thee, O Savior blest.
    With Thy gracious aid defend us,
    Let Thy guiding light attend us,
    Bring us to Thy place of rest.
    Amen
