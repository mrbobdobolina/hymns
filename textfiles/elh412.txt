Hymn #412 - Come to Calvary's Holy Mountain
Tune: NAAR MIT OIE
File: elh412.txt

[1] Come to Calv'ry's holy mountain,
    Sinners, ruined by the fall;
    Here a pure and healing fountain
    Flows to you, to me, to all,
    In a full, perpetual tide,
    Opened when our Savior died.

[2] Come in poverty and meanness,
    Come defiled, without, within;
    From infection and uncleanness,
    From the leprosy of sin,
    Wash your robes and make them white;
    Ye shall walk with God in light.

[3] Come in sorrow and contrition,
    Wounded, paralyzed, and blind;
    Here the guilty, free remission,
    Here the troubled, peace may find,
    Health this fountain will restore;
    He that drinks shall thirst no more.

[4] He that drinks shall live forever;
    'Tis a soul-renewing flood.
    God is faithful; God will never
    Break His covenant of blood,
    Signed when our Redeemer died,
    Sealed when He was glorified.
    Amen
