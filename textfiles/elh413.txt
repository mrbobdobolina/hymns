Hymn #413 - Come unto Me, Ye Weary
Tune: ANTHES
File: elh413.txt

[1] "Come unto Me, ye weary,
    And I will give you rest."
    O blessed voice of Jesus,
    Which comes to hearts oppressed!
    It tells of benediction,
    Of pardon, grace, and peace,
    Of joy that hath no ending,
    Of love that cannot cease.

[2] "Come unto Me, ye wand'rers,
    And I will give you light."
    O loving voice of Jesus,
    Which comes to cheer the night!
    Our hearts were filled with sadness,
    And we had lost our way;
    But Thou hast brought us gladness
    And songs at break of day.

[3] "Come unto Me, ye fainting,
    And I will give you life."
    O cheering voice of Jesus,
    Which comes to aid our strife!
    The foe is stern and eager,
    The fight is fierce and long;
    But Thou hast made us mighty
    And stronger than the strong.

[4] "And whosoever cometh,
    I will not cast him out."
    O patient love of Jesus,
    Which drives away our doubt,
    Which, though we be unworthy
    Of love so great and free,
    Invites us very sinners
    To come, dear Lord, to Thee!
    Amen
