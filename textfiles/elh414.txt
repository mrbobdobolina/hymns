Hymn #414 - Through Jesus' Blood and Merit
Tune: LOB GOTT GETROST MIT SINGEN
File: elh414.txt

[1] Through Jesus' blood and merit
    I am at peace with God;
    What, then, can daunt my spirit,
    However dark my road?
    My courage shall not fail me,
    For God is on my side;
    Though hell itself assail me,
    Its rage I may deride.

[2] There's nothing that can sever
    Me from this love of God,
    No want, no pain whatever,
    No famine, peril, flood.
    Though thousand foes surround me,
    For slaughter mark His sheep,
    They never shall confound me,
    The vict'ry I shall reap.

[3] Yea, neither life's temptation
    Nor death's so trying hour,
    Nor angels of high station,
    Nor any other pow'r,
    Nor things that now are present,
    Nor things that are to come,
    Nor height, however pleasant,
    Nor depth of deepest gloom,

[4] Nor any creature ever
    Shall from the love of God
    This wretched sinner sever,
    For in my Savior's blood
    This love its fountain taketh;
    God hears my faithful prayer
    And nevermore forsaketh
    His own dear child and heir.
    Amen
