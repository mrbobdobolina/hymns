Hymn #416 - Blest Is the Man, Forever Blest
Tune: DIE HELLE SONN LEUCHT
File: elh416.txt

[1] Blest is the man, forever blest,
    Whose guilt is pardoned by his God,
    Whose sins with sorrow are confessed
    And covered with his Savior's blood.

[2] Blest is the man to whom the Lord
    Imputes not his iniquities;
    He pleads no merit of reward
    And not on works but grace relies.

[3] From guile his heart and lips are free;
    His humble joy, his holy fear,
    With deep repentance well agree
    And join to prove his faith sincere.

[4] How glorious is that righteousness
    That hides and cancels all his sins,
    While bright the evidence of grace
    Through all his life appears and shines!
    Amen
