Hymn #417 - "So Truly As I Live", God Saith
Tune: SO WAHR ICH LEB
File: elh417.txt

[1] "So truly as I live," God saith,
    "I would not have the sinner's death,
    But that he turn from error's ways,
    Repent, and live through endless days."

[2] To us therefore Christ gave command:
    "Go forth and preach in ev'ry land;
    Bestow on all My pard'ning grace
    Who will repent and mend their ways.

[3] "All those whose sins ye thus remit
    I truly pardon and acquit,
    And those whose sins ye do retain
    Condemned and guilty shall remain.

[4] "What ye shall bind, that bound shall be;
    What ye shall loose, that shall be free;
    Unto My Church the keys are giv'n
    To ope and close the gates of heav'n."

[5] They who believe when ye proclaim
    The joyful tidings in My name
    That I for them My blood have shed,
    Are free from guilt and Judgment dread.

[6] The words which absolution give
    Are His who died that we might live;
    The minister who Christ has sent
    Is but His humble instrument.

[7] However great our sin may be,
    The absolution sets us free,
    Appointed by God's own dear Son
    To bring the pardon He has won.

[8] When ministers lay on their hands,
    Absolved by Christ the sinner stands;
    He who by grace the Word believes
    The purchase of His blood receives.

[9] This is the pow'r of Holy Keys,
    It binds and doth again release;
    The Church e'er has them at her side,
    Our Mother and Christ's holy Bride.

[10] All praise, eternal Son, to Thee
     For absolution full and free,
     In which Thou showest forth Thy grace;
     From false indulgence guard our race.

[11] Praise God the Father and the Son
     And Holy Spirit, Three in One,
     As 'twas, is now, and so shall be
     World without end, eternally!
     Amen
