Hymn #418 - How Fair the Church of Christ Shall Stand
Tune: MELITA
File: elh418.txt

[1] How fair the Church of Christ shall stand,
    A beacon light in all the land,
    When love and faith all hearts inspire,
    And all unite in one desire
    To be a fam'ly and agree
    To live in peace and unity.

[2] 'Tis all in vain that you profess
    The doctrines of the Church, unless
    You live according to your creed,
    And show your faith by word and deed.
    Observe the rule: To others do
    As you would have them do to you.

[3] Resentment, hate, and cruel jest,
    Must not be harbored in the breast
    Where love and charity should dwell;
    Then think and speak of others well,
    Refrain from all that causes strife
    And mars a truly Christian life.

[4] So let your tongue, your heart, and mind
    Agree to banish ev'ry kind
    Of malice, falsehood and disguise,
    And here on earth a paradise
    Of peace and harmony maintain,
    Where concord and good will shall reign.

[5] For God observes our thoughts and deeds,
    The secrets of our heart He reads;
    The wicked cannot be concealed,
    Their evil ways shall be revealed,
    He ev'ry true believer knows,
    And love and grace on him bestows.

[6] My soul, be therefore of good cheer,
    Though sinners threaten, scoff, and sneer,
    Serenely on your way proceed,
    Nor worldly strife and clamor heed,
    For Jesus' sake the cross you bear,
    And soon with Him the crown shall wear.

[7] O gracious God, wilt Thou my heart
    So fashion in each secret part,
    That Thou be sanctified in me,
    Till Thee in heav'n above I see,
    Where holy, holy, holy Lord,
    We sing to Thee with one accord.
    Amen
