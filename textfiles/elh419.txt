Hymn #419 - Most Ancient of All Mysteries
Tune: DETROIT
File: elh419.txt

[1] Most ancient of all mysteries,
    Before Thy throne we lie;
    Have mercy now, most merciful
    Most holy Trinity.

[2] When heav'n and earth were yet unmade,
    When time was yet unknown,
    Thou in Thy bliss and majesty
    Didst live and love alone.

[3] Thou wert not born; there was no fount
    From which Thy Being flowed;
    There is no end which Thou canst reach;
    But Thou art simply God.

[4] How wonderful creation is,
    The work which Thou didst bless,
    And O what then must Thou be like,
    Eternal loveliness!

[5] O listen then, most pitiful,
    To Thy poor creature's heart:
    It blesses Thee that Thou art God,
    That Thou art what thou art.

[6] Most ancient of all mysteries,
    Still at Thy throne we lie;
    Have mercy now, most merciful,
    Most holy Trinity.
    Amen
