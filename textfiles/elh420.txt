Hymn #420 - Blest Be the Tie That Binds
Tune: BOYLSTON
File: elh420.txt

[1] Blest be the tie that binds
    Our hearts in Christian love;
    The fellowship of kindred minds
    Is like to that above.

[2] Before our Father's throne
    We pour our ardent prayers;
    Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
    Our comforts and our cares.

[3] We share our mutual woes,
    Our mutual burdens bear,
    And often for each other flows
    The sympathizing tear.

[4] When here our pathways part,
    We suffer bitter pain;
    Yet, one in Christ and one in heart,
    We hope to meet again.

[5] This glorious hope revives
    Our courage by the way,
    While each in expectation lives
    And longs to see the day.

[6] From sorrow, toil, and pain,
    And sin we shall be free
    And perfect love and friendship reign
    Through all eternity.
    Amen
