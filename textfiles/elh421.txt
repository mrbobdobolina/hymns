Hymn #421 - We Are Called by One Vocation
Tune: KOMM, O KOMM, DU GEIST DES LEBENS
File: elh421.txt

[1] We are called by one vocation,
    Members of one family,
    Heirs through Christ of one salvation,
    Let us live in harmony;
    Nor by strife embitter life,
    Journeying to eternity.

[2] In a land where all are strangers,
    And our sojourning so short,
    In the midst of common dangers
    Concord is our best support;
    Heart with heart divides the smart,
    Lightens grief of ev'ry sort.

[3] Let us shun all vain contention
    Touching words and outward things,
    Whence, alas! so much dissension
    And such bitter rancor springs;
    Troubles cease, where Christ brings peace
    And sweet healing on His wings.

[4] Judge not hastily of others,
    But thine own salvation mind;
    Nor be mindful of thy brother's
    To thine own offenses blind;
    God alone discerns thine own,
    And the hearts of all mankind.

[5] Let it be our chief endeavor
    That we may the Lord obey,
    Then shall envy cease forever
    And all hate be done away;
    Free from strife shall be his life
    Who serves God both night and day!
    Amen
