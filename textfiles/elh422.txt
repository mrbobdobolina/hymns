Tune: MACHS MIT MIR, GOTT

[1] "Come, follow Me," the Savior spake,
    "All in My way abiding;
    Deny yourselves, the world forsake,
    Obey My call and guiding.
    O bear the cross, whate'er betide,
    Take My example for your guide.

[2] "I am the Light; I light the way,
    A godly life displaying;
    I bid you walk as in the day;
    I keep your feet from straying.
    I am the Way, and well I show
    How you must sojourn here below.

[3] "I teach you how to shun and flee
    What harms your soul's salvation,
    Your heart from ev'ry guile to free,
    From sin and its temptation.
    I am the Refuge of the soul
    And lead you to your heav'nly goal.

[4] "Thus when you find most hot the fray,
    I at your side stand ready;
    The fight is Mine, I lead the way,
    At all times firm and steady.
    A soldier false who will not heed
    When Christ the Captain takes the lead!

[5] "Who seeks to save on earth his life
    Without Me, he shall lose it:
    But who for Me in earthly strife
    Now loses it shall find it;
    Who counts the cross for Me too hard
    Is worthy no of Me, the Lord."

[6] Then let us follow Christ, our Lord,
    And take the cross appointed
    And, firmly clinging to His Word,
    In suff'ring be undaunted.
    For those who bear the battle's strain
    The crown of life they shall obtain.
    Amen
