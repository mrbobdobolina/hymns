Hymn #423 - How Can I Thank You, Lord
Tune: O GOTT, DU FROMMER GOTT
File: elh423.txt

[1] How can I thank You, Lord,
    For all Your loving-kindness,
    That You have patiently
    Borne with me in my blindness?
    When dead in many sins
    And trespasses I lay,
    I kindled, holy God,
    Your anger ev'ry day.

[2] It is Your work alone
    That I am now converted;
    O'er Satan's work in me
    You have Your might asserted.
    Your mercy and Your grace
    That rise afresh each morn
    Have turned my stony heart
    Into a heart newborn.

[3] Lord, You have raised me up
    To joy and exultation,
    And led me on the way
    That I may know salvation.
    My sins are washed away,
    For this I thank You, Lord;
    And with my heart and soul
    I trust Your holy Word.

[4] Grant that Your Spirit's help
    To me be always given
    Lest I should fall again
    And lose the way to heaven;
    That He may give me strength
    In my infirmity;
    And e'er renew my heart
    To serve You willingly.
    Amen
