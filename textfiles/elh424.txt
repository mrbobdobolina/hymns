Hymn #424 - Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken
Tune: ROSENMULLER
File: elh424.txt

[1] Jesus, I my cross have taken,
    All to leave and follow Thee.
    Destitute, despised, forsaken,
    Thou from hence, my all shalt be.
    Perish ev'ry fond ambition,
    All I've sought, and hoped, and known;
    Yet how rich is my condition!
    God and heav'n are still my own.

[2] Let the world despise and leave me;
    They have left my Savior, too.
    Human hearts and looks deceive me;
    Thou art not, like them, untrue.
    And while Thou shalt smile upon me,
    God of wisdom, love, and might,
    Foes may hate and friends may shun me--
    Show Thy face, and all is bright.

[3] Go, then, earthly fame and treasure!
    Come, disaster, scorn, and pain!
    In Thy service, pain is pleasure;
    With Thy favor, loss is gain.
    I have called Thee Abba, Father;
    I have stayed my heart on Thee.
    Storms may howl, and clouds may gather;
    All must work for good to me.

[4] Man may trouble and distress me,
    'Twill but drive me to Thy breast;
    Life with trials hard may press me,
    Heav'n will bring me sweeter rest.
    O 'tis not in grief to harm me
    While Thy love is left to Thee.
    O 'twere not in joy to charm me
    Were that joy unmixed with Thee.

[5] Take, my soul, thy full salvation,
    Rise o'er sin and fear and care;
    Joy to find in ev'ry station,
    Something still to do or bear.
    Think what Spirit dwells within thee,
    What a Father's smile is thine,
    What a Savior died to win thee;
    Child of heav'n, shouldst thou repine?

[6] Haste, then, on from grace to glory,
    Armed by faith and winged by prayer.
    Heav'n's eternal day's before thee,
    God's own hand shall guide thee there.
    Soon shall close the earthly mission,
    Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days,
    Hope soon change to glad fruition,
    Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
    Amen
