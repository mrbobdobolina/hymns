Tune: MEINEN JESUM LASS ICH NICHT
File: elh426.txt

[1] Jesus sinners doth receive;
    O may all this saying ponder
    Who in sin's delusions live
    And from God and heaven wander.
    Here is hope for all who grieve--
    Jesus sinners doth receive.

[2] We deserve but grief and shame,
    Yet His words, rich grace revealing,
    Pardon, peace, and life proclaim;
    Here their ills have perfect healing
    Who with humble hearts believe--
    Jesus sinners doth receive.

[3] Sheep that from the fold did stray
    No true shepherd e'er forsaketh;
    Weary souls that lost their way
    Christ, the Shepherd, gently taketh
    In His arms that they may live--
    Jesus sinners doth receive.

[4] Come, ye sinners, one and all,
    Come, accept His invitation.
    Come, obey His gracious call;
    Come and take His free salvation!
    Firmly in these words believe--
    Jesus sinners doth receive.

[5] I, a sinner, come to Thee
    With a penitent confession.
    Savior, mercy show to me;
    Grant for all my sins remission.
    Let these words my soul relieve--
    Jesus sinners doth receive.

[6] O how blest it is to know,
    Were as scarlet my transgression,
    It shall be as white as snow
    By Thy blood and bitter Passion,
    For these words I now believe--
    Jesus sinners doth receive.

[7] Now my conscience is at peace,
    From the Law I stand acquitted;
    Christ hath purchased my release
    And my ev'ry sin remitted.
    Naught remains my soul to grieve--
    Jesus sinners doth receive.

[8] Jesus sinners doth receive.
    Also I have been forgiven.
    And when I this earth must leave,
    I shall find an open heaven.
    Dying, still to Him I cleave--
    Jesus sinners doth receive.
    Amen
