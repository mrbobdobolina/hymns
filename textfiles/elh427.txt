File: elh427.txt

[1] Let me be Thine forever,
    Thou faithful God and Lord;
    Let me forsake Thee never
    Nor wander from Thy Word.
    Lord, do not let me waver
    But give me steadfastness,
    And for such grace forever
    Thy holy name I'll bless.

[2] Lord Jesus, my Salvation,
    My Light, my Life divine,
    My only Consolation,
    O make me wholly Thine,
    For Thou hast dearly bought me
    With blood and bitter pain.
    Let me, since Thou hast sought me,
    Eternal life obtain.

[3] And Thou, O Holy Spirit,
    My Comforter and Guide,
    Grant that in Jesus' merit
    I always may confide,
    Him to the end confessing
    Whom I have known by faith.
    Grant me Thy constant blessing
    And grant a Christian death.
    Amen
