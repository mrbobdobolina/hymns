Hymn #429 - Chief of Sinners Though I Be
Tune: GETHSEMANE
File: elh429.txt

[1] Chief of sinners though I be,
    Jesus shed His blood for me,
    Died that I might live on high,
    Lived that I might never die.
    As the branch is to the vine,
    I am His, and He is mine.

[2] O the height of Jesus' love,
    Higher than the heav'ns above,
    Deeper than the depths of sea,
    Lasting as eternity.
    Love that found me--wondrous thought!
    Found me when I sought Him not.

[3] Jesus only can impart
    Balm to heal the smitten heart,
    Peace that flows from sin forgiv'n,
    Joy that lifts the soul to heav'n;
    Faith and hope to walk with God
    In the way that Enoch trod.

[4] Chief of sinners though I be,
    Christ is All in all to me;
    All my wants to Him are known,
    All my sorrows are His own.
    Safe with Him from earthly strife,
    He sustains the hidden life.

[5] O my Savior, help afford
    By Thy Spirit and Thy Word!
    When my wayward heart would stray,
    Keep me in the narrow way;
    Grace in time of need supply
    While I live and when I die.
    Amen
