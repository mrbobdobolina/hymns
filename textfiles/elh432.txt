Tune: HERRNHUT
File: elh432.txt

[1] Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness
    My beauty are, my glorious dress;
    'Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
    With joy shall I lift up my head.

[2] Bold shall I stand in that great day;
    For who ought to my charge shall lay?
    Fully through these absolved I am
    From sin and fear, from guilt and shame.

[3] The holy, meek, unspotted Lamb
    Who from the Father's bosom came,
    Who died for me, e'en me to atone,
    Now for my Lord and God I own.

[4] Lord, I believe Thy precious blood,
    Which at the mercy seat of God
    Forever doth for sinners plead,
    For me--e'en for my soul--was shed.

[5] Lord, I believe were sinners more
    Than sands upon the ocean shore,
    Thou hast for all a ransom paid,
    For all a full atonement made.

[6] When from the dust of earth I rise
    To claim my mansion in the skies,
    E'en then this shall be all my plea:
    "Jesus hath lived, hath died, for me."

[7] Thus Abraham, the friend of God,
    Thus all heav'n's armies bought with blood,
    Savior of sinners Thee proclaim;
    Sinners, of whom the chief I am.

[8] Jesus, be endless praise to Thee,
    Whose boundless mercy hath for me,
    For me, and all Thy hands have made,
    An everlasting ransom paid.

[9] Ah, give to all, Almighty Lord,
    With pow'r to speak Thy gracious Word,
    That all who to Thy wounds will flee
    May find eternal life in Thee.

[10] Thou God of pow'r, Thou God of love,
     Let the whole world Thy mercy prove!
     Now let Thy Word o'er all prevail!
     Now take the spoils of death and hell.

[11] O let the dead hear now Thy voice!
     Now bid Thy banished ones rejoice!
     Their beauty this, their glorious dress,
     Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness.
     Amen
