Hymn #433 - Not What These Hands Have Done
Tune: TERRA PATRIS
File: elh433.txt

[1] Not what these hands have done
    Can save this guilty soul;
    Not what this toiling flesh has borne
    Can make my spirit whole.
    Not what I feel or do
    Can give me peace with God;
    Not all my prayers and sighs and tears
    Can bear my awful load.

[2] Thy work alone, O Christ,
    Can ease this weight of sin;
    Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,
    Can give me peace within.
    Thy love to me, O God,
    Not mine, O Lord, to Thee,
    Can rid me of this dark unrest
    And set my spirit free.

[3] Thy grace alone, O God,
    To me can pardon speak;
    Thy pow'r alone, O Son of God,
    Can this sore bondage break.
    I bless the Christ of God,
    I rest on love divine,
    By God's free gift of saving faith
    I call this Savior mine.
    Amen
