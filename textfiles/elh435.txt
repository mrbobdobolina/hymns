Tune: LOBT GOTT DEN HERREN, IHR
File: elh435.txt

[1] All praise to God who reigns above,
    The God of all creation,
    The God of wonders, pow'r, and love,
    The God of our salvation!
    With healing balm my soul He fills,
    The God who ev'ry sorrow stills--
    To God all praise and glory!

[2] What God's almighty pow'r hath made,
    His gracious mercy keepeth;
    By morning dawn or evening shade
    His watchful eye ne'er sleepeth;
    Within the kingdom of His might,
    Lo, all is just and all is right--
    To God all praise and glory!

[3] I cried to Him in time of need:
    Lord God, oh, hear my calling!
    For death He gave me life indeed
    And kept my feet from falling.
    For this my thanks shall endless be;
    O thank Him, thank our God with me--
    To God all praise and glory!

[4] The Lord forsaketh not His flock,
    His chosen generation;
    He is their Refuge and their Rock,
    Their Peace and their Salvation.
    As with a mother's tender hand
    He leads His own, His chosen band--
    To God all praise and glory!

[5] Ye who confess Christ's holy name,
    To God give praise and glory!
    Ye who the Father's pow'r proclaim,
    To God give praise and glory!
    All idols under foot be trod;
    The Lord is God! The Lord is God!
    To God all praise and glory!

[6] Then come before His presence now
    And banish fear and sadness;
    To your Redeemer pay your vow
    And sing with joy and gladness:
    Though great distress my soul befell,
    The Lord, my God did all things well--
    To God all praise and glory!
    Amen
