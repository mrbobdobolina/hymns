Tune: CHRISTE SANCTORUM
File: elh436.txt

[1] Father most holy, merciful, and tender
    Jesus, our Savior, with the Father reigning;
    Spirit all-kindly, Advocate, Defender,
    Light never waning.

[2] Trinity sacred, Unity unshaken;
    Deity perfect, giving and forgiving,
    Light of the angels, Life of the forsaken,
    Hope of all living.

[3] Maker of all things, all Thy creatures praise Thee;
    Lo, all things serve Thee through Thy whole creation;
    Hear us, Almighty, hear us as we raise Thee
    Heart's adoration.

[4] To the almighty triune God be glory:
    Highest and greatest, help Thou our endeavor;
    We, too, would praise Thee, giving honor worthy,
    Now and forever.
    Amen
