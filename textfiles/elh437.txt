Hymn #437 - In Jesus I Find Rest and Peace
Tune: I JESUS SOGER JEG MIN FRED
File: elh437.txt

[1] In Jesus I find rest and peace--
    The world is full of sorrow;
    His wounds are my abiding-place;
    Let the unknown tomorrow
    Bring what it may, There I can stay,
    My faith finds all I need today,
    I will not trouble borrow.

[2] Until I found that crystal spring,
    My way was dull and dreary;
    I looked for peace in many a thing;
    But still my soul grew weary.
    Unsatisfied, All things I tried,
    And yet my soul had not espied
    The fount of life so near me.

[3] My soul was carnal, blind, and bound
    By sin, and never sought Thee,
    Lord Jesus, though I ever found
    All else no comfort brought me,
    No peace, no rest Within my breast;
    My troubled soul remained unblest,
    Of Thee I ne'er bethought me.

[4] In pity, then, Thou cam'st to me,
    Thine arms to me extending;
    I heard Thy voice: Come unto me
    And rest in peace unending.
    Immanuel Loves thee full well,
    He saves thy soul from death and hell,
    In perils thee defending.

[5] O Jesus, I must now confess
    The world hath but vexation
    And anguish, sorrow, dire distress,
    As is Thy declaration.
    In Thee is peace And sweet surcease;
    Thy bosom is my resting-place
    Where I find consolation.

[6] To me the preaching of the cross
    Is wisdom everlasting;
    Thy death alone redeems my loss;
    On Thee my burden casting,
    I, in Thy name, A refuge claim
    From sin and death and from all shame--
    Blest be Thy name, O Jesus!

[7] O Jesus, may I constant be,
    Forever with Thee staying!
    O may I feel love's mastery,
    My ev'ry fear allaying!
    The dove at last Hath found sweet rest
    From all her weary, futile quest,
    Although she long went straying.
    Amen
