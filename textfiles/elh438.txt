Hymn #438 - Come, O Come, Thou Quickening Spirit
Tune: KOMM, O KOMM, DU GEIST DES LEBENS
File: elh438.txt

[1] Come, O come, Thou quick'ning Spirit,
    God from all eternity!
    May Thy power never fail us;
    Dwell within us constantly.
    Then shall truth and life and light
    Banish all the gloom of night.

[2] Grant our hearts in fullest measure
    Wisdom, counsel, purity,
    That they ever may be seeking
    Only that which pleaseth Thee.
    Let Thy knowledge spread and grow,
    Working error's overthrow.

[3] Show us, Lord, the path of blessing;
    When we trespass on our way,
    Cast, O Lord, our sins behind Thee
    And be with us day by day.
    Should we stray, O Lord, recall;
    Work repentance when we fall.

[4] With our spirit bear Thou witness
    That we are the sons of God
    Who rely upon Him solely
    When we pass beneath the rod;
    For we know, as children should,
    That the cross is for our good.

[5] Prompt us, Lord, to come before Him
    With a childlike heart to pray;
    Sigh in us, O Holy Spirit,
    When we know not what to say.
    Then our prayer is not in vain,
    And our faith new strength shall gain.

[6] If our soul can find no comfort,
    If despondency grows strong,
    And the heart cries out in anguish:
    "O my God, how long, how long?"
    Comfort then our aching breast,
    Grant it courage, patience, rest.

[7] Holy Spirit, strong and mighty,
    Thou who makest all things new,
    Make Thy work within us perfect
    And the evil foe subdue.
    Grant us weapons for the strife
    And with vict'ry crown our life.

[8] Guard, O God, our faith forever;
    Let not Satan, death, or shame
    Ever part us from our Savior;
    "Lord our Refuge" is Thy name.
    Though our flesh cry ever: Nay!
    Be Thy Word to us still Yea!

[9] And when life's frail thread is breaking,
    Then assure us more and more,
    As the heirs of life unending,
    Of the glory there in store,
    Glory never yet expressed,
    Glory of the saints at rest.
    Amen
