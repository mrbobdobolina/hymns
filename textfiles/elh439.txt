Tune: HERZLIEBSTER JESU
File: elh439.txt

[1] Lord of our life and God of our salvation,
    Star of our night and Hope of ev'ry nation,
    Hear and receive Thy Church's supplication,
    Lord God Almighty.

[2] See round Thine ark the hungry billows curling;
    See how Thy foes their banners are unfurling.
    Lord, while their darts envenomed they are hurling,
    Thou canst preserve us.

[3] Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armor faileth;
    Lord, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth;
    Lord, o'er Thy Church nor death nor hell prevaileth;
    Grant us Thy peace, Lord:

[4] Peace in our hearts, our evil thoughts assuaging;
    Peace in Thy Church where brothers are engaging
    Peace when the world its busy war is waging.
    Calm Thy foes' raging.

[5] Grant us Thy help till backward they are driven;
    Grant them Thy truth that they may be forgiven;
    Grant peace on earth or, after we have striven,
    Peace in Thy heaven.
    Amen
