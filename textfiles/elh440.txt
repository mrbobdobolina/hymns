Hymn #440 - O Lord, Look Down from Heaven, Behold
Tune: ACH GOTT VOM HIMMEL
File: elh440.txt

[1] O Lord, look down from heav'n, behold,
    And let Thy pity waken.
    How few are we within Thy fold,
    Thy saints by men forsaken;
    True faith seems quenched on ev'ry hand;
    Men suffer not Thy Word to stand.
    Dark times have us o'ertaken.

[2] With fraud which they themselves invent
    Thy truth they have confounded;
    Their hearts are not with one consent
    On Thy pure doctrine grounded.
    While they parade with outward show,
    They lead the people to and fro,
    In error's maze astounded.

[3] May God root out all heresy,
    And of false teachers rid us
    Who proudly say: "Now, where is he
    That shall our speech forbid us?
    By right or might we shall prevail;
    What we determine cannot fail;
    We own no lord and master."

[4] Therefore saith God, "I must arise,
    The poor My help are needing.
    To Me ascend My people's cries,
    And I have heard their pleading.
    For them My saving Word shall fight
    And fearlessly and sharply smite,
    The poor with might defending."

[5] As silver tried by fire is pure
    From all adulteration,
    So through God's Word shall men endure
    Each trial and temptation.
    Its light beams brighter through the cross,
    And, purified from human dross,
    It shines through ev'ry nation.

[6] Defend Thy truth, O God, and stay
    This evil generation;
    And from the error of its way
    Keep Thine own congregation.
    The wicked ev'rywhere abound
    And would Thy little flock confound;
    But Thou art our Salvation.
    Amen
