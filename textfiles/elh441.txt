Hymn #441 - O that the Lord Would Guide My Ways
Tune: EVAN
File: elh441.txt

[1] O that the Lord would guide my ways
    To keep His statutes still!
    O that my God would grant me grace
    To know and do His will!

[2] Order my footsteps by Thy Word
    And make my heart sincere;
    Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
    But keep my conscience clear.

[3] Assist my soul, too apt to stray,
    A stricter watch to keep;
    And should I e'er forget Thy way,
    Restore Thy wand'ring sheep.

[4] Make me to walk in Thy commands,
    A most delightful road--
    Nor let my head or heart or hands
    Offend against my God.
    Amen
