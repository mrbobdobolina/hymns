Hymn #442 - King of Glory, King of Peace
Tune: GENERAL SEMINARY
File: elh442.txt

[1] King of glory, King of peace,
    I will love Thee;
    And that love may never cease,
    I will move Thee.
    Thou hast granted my request,
    Thou hast heard me;
    Thou didst note my working breast,
    Thou hast spared me.

[2] Wherefore with my utmost art
    I will sing Thee,
    And the cream of all my heart
    I will bring Thee.
    Though my sins against me cried,
    Thou didst clear me;
    And alone, when they replied,
    Thou didst hear me.

[3] Sev'n whole days, not one in sev'n,
    I will praise Thee;
    In my heart, though not in heav'n,
    I can raise Thee.
    Small it is in this poor sort
    To enroll Thee;
    E'en eternity's too short
    To extol Thee.
    Amen
