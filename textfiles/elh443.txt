Hymn #443 - O that I Had a Thousand Voices
Tune: O DASS ICH TAUSEND ZUNGEN HATTE
File: elh443.txt

[1] O that I had a thousand voices
    To praise my God with thousand tongues!
    My heart, which in the Lord rejoices,
    Would then proclaim in grateful songs
    To all, wherever I might be,
    What great things God hath done for me.

[2] O all ye pow'rs that He implanted,
    Arise, and silence keep no more;
    Put forth the strength that He hath granted,
    Your noblest work is to adore.
    O soul and body, be ye meet
    With heartfelt praise your Lord to greet!

[3] Ye forest leaves so green and tender,
    That dance for joy in summer air;
    Ye meadow grasses, bright and slender;
    Ye flow'rs, so wondrous sweet and fair;
    Ye live to show His praise alone,
    With me now make His glory known.

[4] All creatures that have breath and motion,
    That throng the earth, the sea, the sky,
    Now join me in my heart's devotion,
    Help me to raise His praises high.
    My utmost pow'rs can ne'er aright
    Declare the wonders of His might.
    Amen
