Hymn #444 - Take My Life and Let It Be
Tune: PATMOS
File: elh444.txt

[1] Take my life and let it be
    Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.
    Take my moments and my days;
    Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

[2] Take my hands and let them move
    At the impulse of Thy love.
    Take my feet and let them be
    Swift and beautiful for Thee.

[3] Take my voice and let me sing
    Always, only for my King.
    Take my lips and let them be
    Filled with messages from Thee.

[4] Take my silver and my gold,
    Not a mite would I withhold.
    Take my intellect and use
    Ev'ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose.

[5] Take my will and make it Thine,
    It shall be no longer mine.
    Take my heart, it is Thine own;
    It shall be Thy royal throne.

[6] Take my love, my Lord, I pour
    At Thy feet its treasure store;
    Take myself, and I will be
    Ever, only, all for Thee.
    Amen
