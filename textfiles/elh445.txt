Hymn #445 - We Give Thee But Thine Own
Tune: SCHUMANN
File: elh445.txt

[1] We give Thee but Thine own,
    Whate'er the gift may be;
    All that we have is Thine alone,
    A trust, O Lord, from Thee.

[2] May we Thy bounties thus
    As stewards true receive
    And gladly, as Thou blessest us,
    To Thee our first fruits give!

[3] O hearts are bruised and dead,
    And homes are bare and cold,
    And lambs for whom the shepherd bled
    Are straying from the fold.

[4] To comfort and to bless,
    To find a balm for woe,
    To tend the lone and fatherless,
    Is angels' work below.

[5] The captive to release,
    To God the lost to bring,
    To teach the way of life and peace--
    It is a Christ-like thing.

[6] And we believe Thy Word,
    Though dim our faith may be:
    Whate'er for Thine we do, O Lord,
    We do it unto Thee.
    Amen
