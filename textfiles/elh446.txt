Hymn #446 - What Is the World to Me
Tune: WAS FRAG ICH NACH DER WELT
File: elh446.txt

[1] What is the world to me
    With all its vaunted pleasure
    When Thou, and Thou alone,
    Lord Jesus, art my Treasure!
    Thou only, dearest Lord,
    My soul's Delight shalt be;
    Thou art my Peace, my Rest.
    What is the world to me!

[2] The world is like a cloud
    And like a vapor fleeting,
    A shadow that declines,
    Swift to its end retreating.
    My Jesus doth abide,
    Though all things fade and flee;
    My everlasting Rock.
    What is the world to me!

[3] The world seeks to be praised
    And honored by the mighty,
    Yet never once reflects
    That they are frail and flighty.
    But what I truly prize
    Above all things is He,
    My Jesus, He alone.
    What is the world to me!

[4] The world seeks after wealth
    And all that Mammon offers,
    Yet never is content
    Though gold should fill its coffers.
    I have a higher good,
    Content with it I'll be:
    My Jesus is my Wealth.
    What is the world to me!

[5] The world is sorely grieved
    Whenever it is slighted
    Or when its hollow fame
    And honor have been blighted.
    Christ, Thy reproach I bear
    Long as it pleaseth Thee;
    I'm honored by my Lord.
    What is the world to me!

[6] The world with wanton pride
    Exalts its sinful pleasures
    And for them foolishly
    Gives up the heav'nly treasures.
    Let others love the world
    With all its vanity;
    I love the Lord, my God.
    What is the world to me!

[7] The world abideth not;
    Lo, like a flash 'twill vanish;
    With all it gorgeous pomp
    Pale death it cannot banish;
    Its riches pass away,
    And all its joys must flee;
    But Jesus doth abide.
    What is the world to me!

[8] What is the world to me!
    My Jesus is my Treasure,
    My Life, my Health, my Wealth,
    My Friend, my Love, my Pleasure,
    My Joy, my Crown, my All,
    My Bliss eternally.
    Once more, then, I declare:
    What is the world to me!
    Amen
