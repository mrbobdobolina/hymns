Hymn #447 - Almighty Father, Heaven and Earth
Tune: O HEILIGE DREIFALTIGKEIT
File: elh447.txt

[1] Almighty Father, heav'n and earth
    With lavish wealth before Thee bow;
    Those treasures owe to Thee their birth,
    Creator, Ruler, Giver, Thou.

[2] The wealth of earth, of sky, of sea,
    The gold, the silver, sparkling gem,
    The waving corn, the bending tree,
    Are Thine; to us Thou lendest them.

[3] To Thee, as early morning's dew,
    Our praises, alms, and prayers shall rise
    As rose, when joyous earth was new,
    Faith's patriarchal sacrifice.

[4] We, Lord, would lay, at Thy behest
    The costliest off'rings on Thy shrine;
    But when we give and give our best,
    We give Thee only what is Thine.

[5] O Father, whence all blessings come;
    O Son, Dispenser of God's store;
    O Spirit, bear our off'rings home:
    Lord, make them Thine forevermore.
    Amen
