Hymn #448 - I Will Sing My Maker's Praises
Tune: SOLLT ICH MEINEM GOTT
File: elh448.txt

[1] I will sing my Maker's praises
    And in Him most joyful be,
    For in all things I see traces
    Of His tender love to me.
    Nothing else than love could move Him
    With such sweet and tender care
    Evermore to raise and bear
    All who try to serve and love Him.
    All things else have but their day,
    God's great love abides for aye.

[2] Yea, so dear did He esteem me
    That His Son He loved so well
    He hath given to redeem me
    From the quenchless flames of hell.
    O Thou Spring of boundless blessing,
    How could e'er my feeble mind
    Of Thy depth the bottom find
    Though my efforts were unceasing?
    All things else have but their day,
    God's great love abides for aye.

[3] All that for my soul is needful
    He with loving care provides,
    Nor of that is He unheedful
    Which my body needs besides.
    When my strength cannot avail me,
    When my pow'rs can do no more,
    Doth my God His strength outpour;
    In my need He doth not fail me.
    All things else have but their day,
    God's great love abides for aye.

[4] When I sleep, He still is near me,
    O'er me rests His guardian eye;
    And new gifts and blessings cheer me
    When the morning streaks the sky.
    Were it not for God's protection,
    Had His countenance not been
    Here my guide, I had not seen
    E'er the end of my affliction.
    All things else have but their day,
    God's great love abides for aye.

[5] As a father never turneth
    Wholly from a wayward child,
    For the prodigal still yearneth,
    Longing to be reconciled,
    So my many sins and errors
    Find a tender, pard'ning God,
    Chast'ning frailty with His rod,
    Not in vengeance with His terrors.
    All things else have but their day,
    God's great love abides for aye.

[6] Since, then, neither change nor coldness
    In my Father's love can be,
    Lo! I lift my hands with boldness,
    As Thy child I come to Thee.
    Grant me grace, O God, I pray Thee,
    That I may with all my might,
    All my lifetime, day and night,
    Love and trust Thee and obey Thee
    And, when this brief life is o'er,
    Praise and love Thee evermore.
    Amen
