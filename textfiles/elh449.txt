Hymn #449 - Thy Love, O Gracious God and Lord
Tune: DURCH ADAMS FALL
File: elh449.txt

[1] Thy love, O gracious God and Lord,
    All other loves excelling,
    Attunes my heart to sweet accord,
    And passes pow'r of telling;
    For when Thy wondrous love I see,
    My heart yields glad submission;
    I love Thee for Thy love to me
    In my poor, lost condition.

[2] Yea, Thou hast loved our fallen race,
    And rather than condemn us,
    Cast out and banish from Thy face
    Thine only Son didst send us;
    Who died upon the cross, that we
    Should all be saved forever;
    Hence Jesus also died for me,
    My soul, forget it never.

[3] Thy love, O God, embraces all,
    And Jesus' merits cover
    The guilt of all, both great and small,
    The world of sinners over.
    Thy Spirit doth Thy light afford
    To all who will receive it,
    And from Thy knowledge bars Thy Word
    No soul who will believe it.

[4] But what hath moved Thee, gracious Lord?
    Why is Thine heart still yearning
    Since the great world rejects Thy Word,
    Thy love and mercy spurning?
    For men go on in sin each day,
    In carnal-minded blindness,
    And O how few Thy call obey
    And heed Thy loving-kindness!

[5] In us no beauty Thou couldst see,
    And no intrinsic merit;
    We all were poor--but misery
    And sin we did inherit.
    We wandered each a diff'rent path,
    And in our lost condition,
    By nature children of His wrath,
    Whom sin doomed to perdition.

[6] Our virtues and our own good deeds
    With God cannot avail us;
    With these the enemy misleads,
    Such righteousness shall fail us;
    Our will and strength and soul are dead
    In evil inclination;
    Christ Jesus has the ransom paid,
    And gained for us salvation.

[7] O gracious God, Thy loving heart
    Was full of sweet compassion;
    And felt our woe and desp'rate smart,
    And planned our restoration;
    Thy grace and justice found a way
    To save us from death's horror;
    And everlasting judgment stay,
    And give us joy for sorrow.

[8] On Christ, the rock, I'm anchored fast,
    By faith in Him remaining;
    I'll weather ev'ry stormy blast,
    My peace of soul retaining;
    On Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
    My ever firm foundation,
    Until the harbor bar is crossed,
    And I see God's salvation.

[9] O Jesus, at my dying breath
    Hold Thou my hand securely,
    And may I in a living faith
    Hold fast to Thee most surely;
    That my last pray'r to Thee may rise,
    My soul to Thee commending,
    And I shall find in Paradise
    The joys of life unending.
    Amen
