Hymn #450 - Lord, to Thee I Make Confession
Tune: HERR, ICH HABE MISSGEHANDELT
File: elh450.txt

[1] Lord, to Thee I make confession:
    I have sinned and gone astray.
    I have multiplied transgression,
    Chosen for myself my way.
    Led by Thee to see my errors,
    Lord, I tremble at Thy terrors.

[2] Yet, though conscience voice appal me,
    Father, I will seek Thy face.
    Though Thy child I dare not call me,
    Yet receive me to Thy grace.
    Do not for my sins forsake me;
    Do not let Thy wrath o'ertake me.

[3] For Thy Son has suffered for me,
    Gave Himself to rescue me,
    Died to heal me and restore me,
    Reconciled me unto Thee.
    'Tis alone His cross can vanquish
    These dark fears and soothe this anguish.

[4] Lord, on Him I cast my burden,
    Sink it in the depths below.
    Let me know Thy gracious pardon;
    Wash me, make me white as snow.
    Let Thy Spirit leave me never;
    Make me only Thine forever.
    Amen
