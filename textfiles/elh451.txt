Hymn #451 - All That I Was
Tune: DETROIT
File: elh451.txt

[1] All that I was, my sin, my guilt,
    My death, was all mine own;
    All that I am I owe to Thee,
    My gracious God, alone.

[2] The evil of my former state
    Was mine, and only mine;
    The good in which I now rejoice
    Is Thine, and only Thine.

[3] The darkness of my former state,
    The bondage, all was mine;
    The light of life in which I walk,
    The liberty, is Thine.

[4] Thy Word first made me feel my sin,
    It taught me to believe;
    Then, in believing, peace I found,
    And now I live, I live!

[5] All that I am, e'en here on earth,
    All that I hope to be,
    When Jesus comes and glory dawns,
    I owe it, Lord, to Thee.
    Amen
