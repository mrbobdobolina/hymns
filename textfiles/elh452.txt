Hymn #452 - Out of the Depths I Cry to Thee
Tune: AUS TIEFER NOT
File: elh452.txt

[1] Out of the depths I cry to Thee;
    Lord, hear me, I implore Thee!
    Thy gracious ear incline to me;
    My prayer let come before Thee.
    On my misdeeds in mercy look,
    O deign to blot them from Thy book,
    Or who can stand before Thee?

[2] Thy love and grace alone avail
    To blot out my transgression;
    The best and holiest deeds must fail
    To break sin's dread oppression.
    Before Thee none can boasting stand,
    But all must fear Thy strict demand
    And live alone by mercy.

[3] Therefore my hope is in the Lord
    And not in mine own merit;
    It rests upon His faithful Word
    To them of contrite spirit
    That He is merciful and just--
    This is my comfort and my trust.
    His help I wait with patience.

[4] And though it tarry through the night
    And till the morning waken,
    My heart shall never doubt His might
    Nor count itself forsaken.
    Do thus, O ye of Israel's seed,
    Ye of the Spirit born indeed;
    Wait for your God's appearing.

[5] Where'er the greatest sins abound
    By grace they are exceeded;
    Thy helping hand is always found
    With aid where aid is needed.
    Our Shepherd good and true is He
    Who will at last His Israel free
    From all their sin and sorrow.
    Amen
