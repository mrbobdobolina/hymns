Hymn #453 - Out of the Deep I Call
Tune: SOUTHWELL
File: elh453.txt

[1] Out of the deep I call
    To Thee, O Lord, to Thee.
    Before Thy throne of grace I fall;
    Be merciful to me.

[2] Out of the deep I cry,
    The woeful deep of sin,
    Of evil done in days gone by,
    Of evil now within;

[3] Out of the deep of fear
    And dread of coming shame;
    All night till morning watch is near
    I plead the precious name.

[4] Lord, there is mercy now,
    As ever was, with Thee.
    Before Thy throne of grace I bow;
    Be merciful to me.
    Amen
