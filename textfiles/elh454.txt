Hymn #454 - Not in Anger, Mighty God
Tune: STRAF MICH NICHT
File: elh454.txt

[1] Not in anger, mighty God,
    Not in anger smite us.
    We must perish if Thy rod
    Justly should requite us.
    We are naught; Sin has brought,
    Lord, Thy wrath upon us.
    Yet have mercy on us!

[2] Show me now a Father's love
    And His tender patience.
    Heal my wounded soul; remove
    These too sore temptations.
    I am weak; Father, speak
    Thou of peace and gladness;
    Comfort Thou my sadness.

[3] Weary am I of my pain,
    Weary with my sorrow,
    Sighing still for help in vain,
    Longing for the morrow.
    Why wilt Thou Tarry now?
    Wilt Thou friendless leave me
    And of hope bereave me?

[4] Hence, ye foes, He come in grace;
    God hath deigned to hear me.
    I may come before His face,
    He is inly near me.
    He o'erthrows All my foes,
    Death and hell are vanquished
    In whose bonds I languished.

[5] Father, hymns to Thee we raise
    Here and once in heaven,
    And the Son and Spirit praise,
    With our bonds have riven.
    Evermore We adore
    Thee whose love hath stirred us
    And whose pity heard us.
    Amen
