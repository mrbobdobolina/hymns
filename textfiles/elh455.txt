Hymn #455 - With Broken Heart and Contrite Sigh
Tune: ST. LUKE
File: elh455.txt

[1] With broken heart and contrite sigh,
    A trembling sinner, Lord, I cry.
    Thy pard'ning grace is rich and free--
    O God, be merciful to me!

[2] I smite upon my troubled breast,
    With deep and conscious guilt oppressed;
    Christ and His cross my only plea--
    O God, be merciful to me!

[3] Far off I stand with tearful eyes
    Nor dare uplift them to the skies,
    But Thou dost all my anguish see--
    O God, be merciful to me!

[4] No alms nor deeds that I have done
    Can for a single sin atone.
    To Calvary alone I flee--
    O God, be merciful to me!

[5] And when, redeemed from sin and hell,
    With all the ransomed throng I dwell,
    My joyous song shall ever be,
    God has been merciful to me.
    Amen
