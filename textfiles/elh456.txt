Hymn #456 - My Soul, Now Bless Thy Maker
Tune: NUN LOB, MEIN SEEL
File: elh456.txt

[1] My soul, now bless thy Maker!
    Let all within me bless His name
    Who maketh thee partaker
    Of mercies more than I dare claim.
    Forget Him not whose meekness
    Still bears with all thy sin,
    Who healeth all thy weakness,
    Renews thy life within;
    Whose grace and care are endless
    And saved thee through the past;
    Who leaves no suff'rer friendless
    But rights the wronged at last.

[2] He shows to man His treasure
    Of judgment, truth, and righteousness,
    His love beyond all measure,
    His yearning pity o'er distress,
    Nor treats us as we merit,
    But lays His anger by.
    The humble, contrite spirit
    Finds His compassion nigh;
    And high as heav'n above us,
    As break from close of day,
    So far, since He doth love us,
    He puts our sins away.

[3] For as a tender father
    Hath pity on his children here,
    He in His arms will gather
    All those who His like child-like fear.
    He knows how frail our powers
    Who but from dust are made.
    We flourish as the flowers,
    And even so we fade.
    The wind but o'er them passes,
    And all their bloom is o'er--
    We wither like the grasses;
    Our place knows us no more.

[4] God's grace alone endureth,
    And children's children yet shall prove
    How He with strength assureth
    The hearts of all that seek His love.
    In heav'n is fixed His dwelling;
    His rule is over all.
    Angels, in might excelling,
    Bright hosts, before Him fall.
    Praise Him who ever reigneth,
    All ye who hear His Word.
    Nor our poor hymns disdaineth--
    My soul, O bless the Lord!
    Amen
