Hymn #457 - Blessed Is the Man
Tune: WERDE MUNTER
File: elh457.txt

[1] Blessed is the man that never
    Doth in godless counsel meet;
    Nor in sinners' way stands ever,
    Nor sits in the scorner's seat,
    But on God's all-perfect law
    Meditates with holy awe;
    Day and night he delves for treasure
    In the Word 'tis all his pleasure.

[2] As a tree that has been planted
    By the flowing waters fair,
    In its season e'er is granted
    Fruits and foliage to bear;
    So is he, the righteous, seen
    Ever fruitful, ever green,
    And his leaf shall wither never,
    All he does shall prosper ever.

[3] To the wicked 'tis not given
    Such a happy lot to share;
    As the chaff by wind is driven
    So shall the ungodly fare;
    They in judgment shall not stand,
    Nor be in the righteous band:
    These the Lord forsaketh never,
    Those shall be cast off forever.

[4] For the Lord His people knoweth,
    His pure eyes behold their way,
    And the blessing He bestoweth
    Is their heritage for aye:
    But the wicked ever tend
    To their doom and to their end:
    God will all the righteous cherish,
    But the wicked ones shall perish.
    Amen
