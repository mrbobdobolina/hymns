Hymn #458 - O God of Mercy, God of Might
Tune: JUST AS I AM
File: elh458.txt

[1] O God of mercy, God of might,
    In love and pity infinite,
    Teach us, as ever in Thy sight,
    To live our life in Thee.

[2] And Thou who cam'st on earth to die,
    That fallen man might live thereby,
    O hear us, for to Thee we cry
    In hope, O Lord, to Thee.

[3] Teach us the lesson Thou hast taught:
    To feel for those Thy blood hath bought,
    That ev'ry word and deed and thought
    May work a work for Thee.

[4] All are redeemed, both far and wide,
    Since Thou, O Lord, for all hast died;
    Then teach us, whatsoe'er betide,
    To love them all in Thee.
    Amen
