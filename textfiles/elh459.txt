Hymn #459 - Lord of Glory, Who Hast Bought Us
Tune: HYFRYDOL
File: elh459.txt

[1] Lord of Glory, who hast bought us
    With Thy lifeblood as the price,
    Never grudging for the lost ones
    That tremendous sacrifice;
    And with that hast freely given
    Blessings countless as the sand
    To th' unthankful and the evil
    With Thine own unsparing hand;

[2] Grant us hearts, dear Lord, to yield Thee
    Gladly, freely, of Thine own;
    With the sunshine of Thy goodness
    Melt our thankless hearts of stone
    Till our cold and selfish natures,
    Warmed by Thee, at length believe
    That more happy and more blessed
    'Tis to give than to receive.

[3] Wondrous honor hast Thou given
    To our humblest charity
    In Thine own mysterious sentence,
    "Ye have done it unto Me."
    Can it be, O gracious Master,
    Thou dost deign for alms to sue,
    Saying by Thy poor and needy,
    "Give as I have giv'n to you"?

[4] Yes, the sorrow and the suff'rings
    Which on ev'ry hand we see
    Channels are for gifts and off'rings
    Due by solemn right to Thee;
    Right of which we may not rob Thee,
    Debt we may not choose but pay
    Lest that face of love and pity
    Turn from us another day.

[5] Lord of Glory, who hast bought us
    With Thy life-blood as the price,
    Never grudging for the lost ones
    That tremendous sacrifice,
    Give us faith to trust Thee boldly,
    Hope, to stay our souls on Thee;
    But, O best of all Thy graces,
    Give us Thine own charity.
    Amen
