Hymn #460 - O How Great Is Thy Compassion
Tune: ACH, WAS SOLL ICH SUNDER MACHEN
File: elh460.txt

[1] O how great is Thy compassion,
    Faithful Father, God of grace,
    That with all our fallen race
    And in our deep degradation
    Thou wast merciful that we
    Might be saved eternally!

[2] Thy great love for this hath striven
    That we may from sin made free
    And forever live with Thee;
    Yea, Thy Son Himself hath given
    In His grace an earnest call
    To His Supper unto all.

[3] And for this our soul's salvation
    Voucheth Thy good Spirit, Lord,
    In Thy Sacraments and Word.
    He imparteth consolation,
    Granteth us the gift of faith
    That we fear nor hell nor death.

[4] Lord, Thy mercy will not leave me;
    Truth doth evermore abide.
    Then in Thee I will confide.
    Since Thy Word cannot deceive me,
    My salvation is to me
    Well assured eternally.

[5] I will praise Thy great compassion,
    Faithful Father, God of grace,
    That with all our fallen race
    And in our deep degradation
    Thou wast merciful that we
    Might bring endless praise to Thee.
    Amen
