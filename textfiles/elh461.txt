Hymn #461 - Come, Ye Thankful People, Come
Tune: ST. GEORGE'S, WINDSOR
File: elh461.txt

[1] Come, ye thankful people, come;
    Raise the song of harvest home.
    All be safely gathered in
    Ere the winter storms begin.
    God, our maker, doth provide
    For our wants to be supplied.
    Come to God's own temple, come;
    Raise the song of harvest home.

[2] All the world is God's own field,
    Fruit unto His praise to yield;
    Wheat and tares together sown,
    Unto joy or sorrow grown.
    First the blade and then the ear,
    Then the full corn shall appear.
    Lord of harvest, grant that we
    Wholesome grain and pure may be.

[3] For the Lord, our God shall come
    And shall take His harvest home,
    From His field shall in that day
    All offenses purge away,
    Give His angels charge at last
    In the fire the tares to cast,
    But the fruitful ears to store
    In His garner evermore.

[4] Even so, Lord, quickly come
    To Thy final harvest home;
    Gather Thou Thy people in,
    Free from sorrow, free from sin,
    There, forever purified,
    In Thy garner to abide.
    Come, with all Thine angels, come;
    Raise the glorious harvest home.
    Amen
