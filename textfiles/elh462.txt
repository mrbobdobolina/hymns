Hymn #462 - As After the Water-Brooks
Tune: SOM TORSTIGE HJORT MONNE SKRIGE
File: elh462.txt

[1] As after the water-brooks panteth
    The hart, when it sinks in the chase,
    So thirsteth my soul as it fainteth
    For Thee, O my God, and Thy grace;
    For Thou art the fount everliving
    Who unto the thirsty art giving
    The water of life that I need.

[2] By day and by night in her anguish
    My soul is lamenting in woe:
    O Lord, in my grief I must languish,
    No counsel, no help do I know;
    When shall I Thy mercy awaken?
    When shall I, the poor and forsaken,
    Before Thee appear, O my God?

[3] Great fears now my courage are rending,
    For near the abyss I am brought,
    My way on the brink I am wending,
    My journey with peril is fraught;
    I faint, I see terrors appalling,
    And into the deep I am falling--
    O harken, O Lord, to my cries!

[4] Lord, Thou art my rock of salvation,
    My house I have built upon Thee;
    O if Thou shouldst fail as foundation,
    My ruin it surely would be;
    Lord, deep unto deep now is calling,
    Thy waves and Thy billows appalling
    Arise to go over my soul.

[5] When others sing anthems of gladness,
    And offer thanksgiving and praise,
    I sit in the gloom of my sadness
    And hear not the anthems they raise;
    My song is the voice of my sighing,
    The festal days pass in my crying--
    I languish in grief and in woe.

[6] Why art thou disquiet within me?
    Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
    Confide in thy God, let Him win thee!
    Still hope in thy God, Him extol!
    For surely once dawneth a morrow,
    When, freed from thy care and thy sorrow,
    Thou praises shalt sing to thy God.

[7] His light and His truth, they shall lead me
    In peace to His temple at last;
    I rest on His Word, He will speed me,
    And conflict and sorrow are past;
    Yea, joyful I anthems will raise Him.
    With heart and with voice will I praise Him--
    My health and my life and my God.
    Amen
