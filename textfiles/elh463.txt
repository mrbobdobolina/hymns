Tune: FRED TIL BOD
File: elh463.txt

[1] For the beauty of the earth,
    For the glory of the skies,
    For the love which from our birth
    Over and around us lies:

[Refrain] Lord of all, to Thee we raise
          This our hymn of grateful praise.

[2] For the wonder of each hour
    Of the day and of the night,
    Hill and vale, and tree and flow'r,
    Sun and moon and stars of light:

[Refrain] Lord of all, to Thee we raise
          This our hymn of grateful praise.

[3] For the joy of human love,
    Brother, sister, parent, child;
    Friends on earth, and friends above,
    Pleasures pure and undefiled:

[Refrain] Lord of all, to Thee we raise
          This our hymn of grateful praise.

[4] For Thy Church that evermore
    Lifts her holy hands above,
    Off'ring up on ev'ry shore
    Her pure sacrifice of love:

[Refrain] Lord of all, to Thee we raise
          This our hymn of grateful praise.
          Amen
