Hymn #464 - Sing to the Lord of Harvest
Tune: WIE LIEBLICH IST DER MAIEN
File: elh464.txt

[1] Sing to the Lord of harvest;
    Sing songs of love and praise.
    With joyful hearts and voices
    Your alleluias raise.
    By Him the rolling seasons
    In fruitful order move;
    Sing to the Lord of harvest
    A song of happy love.

[2] By Him the clouds drop goodness;
    The deserts bloom and spring.
    The hills leap up in gladness;
    The valleys laugh and sing.
    He filleth with His fullness,
    All things with large increase;
    He crowns the year with goodness,
    With plenty, and with peace.

[3] Heap on His sacred altar
    The gifts His goodness gave,
    The golden sheaves of harvest,
    The souls He died to save.
    Your hearts lay down before Him
    When at His feet ye fall,
    And with your lives adore Him
    Who gave His life for all.
    Amen
