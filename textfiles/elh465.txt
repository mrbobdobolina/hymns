Hymn #465 - From God Shall Naught Divide Me
Tune: VON GOTT WILL ICH NICHT LASSEN
File: elh465.txt

[1] From God shall naught divide me,
    For He is true for aye,
    And on my path will guide me,
    Who else should often stray;
    His ever bounteous hand
    By night and day is heedful,
    And gives me what is needful,
    Where e'er I go or stand.

[2] When man's help and affection
    Shall unavailing prove,
    God grants me His protection
    And shows His pow'r and love.
    He helps in ev'ry need,
    From sin and shame redeems me,
    From chains and bonds reclaims me,
    Yea, e'en from death I'm freed.

[3] If sorrow comes, I'll bear it
    In patience and in trust;
    My Lord Himself doth share it,
    For He is true and just,
    And loves to bless us still;
    My life and soul--I owe them
    To Him who doth bestow them,
    Let Him do as He will.

[4] Whate'er shall be His pleasure
    Is surely best for me;
    He gave His dearest treasure,
    That our weak hearts might see
    How good His will toward us;
    And in His Son He gave us
    Whate'er could bless and save us;
    Praise Him who loveth thus!

[5] O praise Him for He never
    Forgets our daily need;
    O blest the hour whenever
    To Him our thoughts can speed;
    Yea, all the time we spend
    Without Him is but wasted,
    Till we His joy have tasted,
    The joy that hath no end.

[6] For when the world is passing
    With all its pomp and pride,
    All we were here amassing
    No longer may abide;
    But in our earthly bed,
    Where softly we are sleeping,
    God hath us in His keeping,
    To wake us from the dead.

[7] Our soul shall never perish,
    But in yon paradise
    The joys of heav'n shall cherish;
    Our body shall arise
    Pure, holy, new-born, free
    From ev'ry sin and evil;
    The tempting of the devil
    We then no more shall see.

[8] Then, though on earth I suffer
    Much trial, well I know
    I merit ways still rougher,
    Yet 'tis to heav'n I go;
    For Christ I know and love,
    To Him I now am hasting,
    And gladness everlasting
    With Him my heart shall prove.

[9] For such His will who made us;
    The Father seeks our good;
    The Son hath grace to aid us,
    And save us by His blood;
    His Spirit rules our ways,
    By faith in us abiding,
    To heav'n our footsteps guiding;
    To Him be thanks and praise.
    Amen
