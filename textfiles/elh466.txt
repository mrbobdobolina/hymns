Tune: KREMSER
File: elh466.txt

[1] We praise Thee, O God, our Redeemer, Creator!
    In grateful devotion our tribute we bring:
    We lay it before Thee; we kneel and adore Thee;
    We bless Thy holy name; glad praises we sing.

[2] We worship Thee, God of our fathers; we bless Thee.
    Through life's storm and tempest our Guide hast Thou been;
    When perils o'ertake us, escape Thou wilt make us,
    And with Thy help, O Lord, our battles we win.

[3] With voices united our praises we offer;
    To Thee, great Jehovah, glad anthems we raise.
    Thy strong arm will guide us; our God is beside us.
    To Thee, our great Redeemer, forever be praise!
    Amen
