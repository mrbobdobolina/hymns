Hymn #467 - In God, My Faithful God
Tune: AUF MEINEN LIEBEN GOTT
File: elh467.txt

[1] In God, my faithful God,
    I trust when dark my road;
    Though many woes o'ertake me,
    Yet He will not forsake me.
    His love it is doth send them
    And, when 'tis best, will end them.

[2] My sins assail me sore,
    But I despair no more.
    I build on Christ, who loves me;
    From this Rock nothing moves me.
    To Him I all surrender,
    To Him, my soul's Defender.

[3] If death my portion be,
    Then death is gain to me
    And Christ my Life forever,
    From whom death cannot sever.
    Come when it may, He'll shield me,
    To Him I wholly yield me.

[4] O Jesus Christ, my Lord,
    So meek in deed and word,
    Thou once didst die to save us
    Because Thy love would have us
    Be heirs of heav'nly gladness
    When ends this life of sadness.

[5] "So be it," then, I say
    With all my heart each day.
    We, too, dear Lord, adore Thee;
    We sing for joy before Thee.
    Guide us while here we wander
    Until we praise Thee yonder.
    Amen
