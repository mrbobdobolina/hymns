Hymn #468 - All Depends on Our Possessing
Tune: ALLES IST AN GOTTES SEGEN
File: elh468.txt

[1] All depends on our possessing
    God's abundant grace and blessing,
    Though all earthly wealth depart.
    He who trusts with faith unshaken
    In his God is not forsaken
    And e'er keep a dauntless heart.

[2] He who hitherto hath fed me
    And to many joys hath led me,
    Is and ever shall be mine.
    He who did so gently school me,
    He who still doth guide and rule me,
    Will remain my Help divine.

[3] Many spend their lives in fretting
    Over trifles and in getting
    Things that lack all solid ground.
    I shall strive to win a treasure
    That will bring me lasting pleasure
    And that now is seldom found.

[4] When with sorrow I am stricken,
    Hope my heart anew will quicken,
    All my longing shall be stilled.
    To His loving-kindness tender
    Soul and body I surrender,
    For on Him alone I build.

[5] Well He knows what best to grant me;
    All the longing hopes that haunt me,
    Joy and sorrow, have their day.
    I shall doubt His wisdom never,
    As God wills, so be it ever;
    I commit to Him my way.

[6] If on earth my days He lengthen,
    He my weary soul will strengthen;
    All my trust in Him I place.
    Earthly wealth is not abiding,
    Like a stream away is gliding;
    Safe I anchor in His grace.
    Amen
