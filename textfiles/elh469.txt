Hymn #469 - Sweet Is the Work
Tune: ST. CRISPIN
File: elh469.txt

[1] Sweet is the work, my God, my King,
    To praise Thy name, give thanks and sing,
    To show Thy love by morning light,
    And talk of all Thy truth at night.

[2] Sweet is the day of sacred rest;
    No mortal cares shall seize my breast;
    My heart shall triumph in my Lord,
    And bless His works, and bless His Word.

[3] And I shall share a glorious part
    When grace hath well refined my heart;
    When doubts and fears no more remain
    To break my inward peace again.

[4] Then shall I see and hear and know
    All I desired or wished below;
    And ev'ry pow'r find sweet employ
    In that eternal world of joy.
    Amen
