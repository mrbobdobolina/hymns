Tune: O GOTT, DU FROMMER GOTT
File: elh470.txt

[1] O God, Thou faithful God,
    Thou fountain ever flowing,
    Without whom nothing is,
    All perfect gifts bestowing;
    A pure and healthy frame
    O give me, and within
    A conscience free from blame,
    A soul unhurt by sin.

[2] And grant me, Lord, to do,
    With ready heart and willing,
    Whate'er Thou shalt command,
    My calling here fulfilling;
    And do it when I ought,
    With all my strength, and bless
    The work I thus have wrought,
    And crown it with success.

[3] And let me promise naught
    But I can keep it truly,
    Abstain from idle words,
    And guard my lips still duly;
    And grant, when in my place
    I must and ought to speak,
    My words due pow'r and grace;
    Nor let me wound the weak.

[4] If dangers gather round,
    Still keep me calm and fearless;
    Help me to bear the cross
    When life is dark and cheerless;
    To overcome my foe
    With words and actions kind;
    When counsel I would know,
    Good counsel let me find.

[5] And let me be with all
    In peace and friendship living,
    As far as Christians may;
    And if Thou aught art giving
    Of wealth and honors fair,
    O this refuse me not,
    That naught be mingled there
    Of goods unjustly got.

[6] And if a longer life
    But here on earth decreed me,
    And Thou through many a strife
    To age at last wilt lead me,
    Thy patience in me shed.
    Avert all sin and shame,
    And crown my aged head
    With pure untarnished fame.

[7] Let nothing that may chance
    Me from my Savior sever;
    And, dying with Him, take
    My soul to Thee for ever;
    And let my body have
    A little space to sleep
    Beside my father's grave,
    And friends that o'er it weep.

[8] And when the end is come
    And all the dead are waking,
    O reach me down Thy hand,
    Thyself my slumbers breaking;
    Then let me hear Thy voice,
    And change this earthly frame,
    And bid me aye rejoice
    With those who love Thy name.
    Amen
