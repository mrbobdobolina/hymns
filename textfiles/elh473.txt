Hymn #473 - For Me to Live Is Jesus
Tune: CHRISTUS, DER IST MEIN LEBEN
File: elh473.txt

[1] For me to live is Jesus,
    To die is gain for me;
    Then, whensoe'er He pleases,
    I meet death willingly.

[2] For Christ, my Lord and Brother,
    I leave this world so dim
    And gladly seek that other,
    Where I shall be with Him.

[3] My woes are nearly over,
    Though long and dark the road;
    My sin His merits cover,
    And I have peace with God.

[4] Lord, when my pow'rs are failing,
    My breath comes heavily,
    And words are unavailing,
    O hear my sighs to Thee.

[5] When mind and thought, O Savior,
    Are flick'ring like a light
    That to and fro doth waver
    Ere 'tis extinguished quite,

[6] In that last hour, O grant me
    To slumber soft and still,
    No doubts to vex or haunt me,
    Safe anchored on Thy will;

[7] And so to Thee still cleaving
    Through all death's agony,
    To fall asleep believing
    And wake in heav'n with Thee.

[8] Amen! Thou, Christ, my Savior,
    Wilt grant this unto me.
    Thy Spirit lead me ever
    That I fare happily.
    Amen
