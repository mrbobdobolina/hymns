Hymn #474 - I'm But a Stranger Here
Tune: HEAVEN IS MY HOME
File: elh474.txt

[1] I'm but a stranger here;
    Heav'n is my home.
    Earth is a desert drear;
    Heav'n is my home.
    Danger and sorrow stand
    Round me on ev'ry hand.
    Heav'n is my fatherland;
    Heav'n is my home.

[2] What though the tempest rage,
    Heav'n is my home.
    Short is my pilgrimage;
    Heav'n is my home.
    And time's wild wintry blast
    Soon shall be overpast;
    I shall reach home at last;
    Heav'n is my home.

[3] There at my Savior's side--
    Heav'n is my home.
    I shall be glorified;
    Heav'n is my home.
    There are the good and blest,
    Those I love most and best,
    And there I, too, shall rest;
    Heav'n is my home.

[4] Therefore I murmur not;
    Heav'n is my home.
    Whate'er my earthly lot;
    Heav'n is my home.
    And I shall surely stand
    There at my Lord's right hand.
    Heav'n is my fatherland;
    Heav'n is my home.
    Amen
