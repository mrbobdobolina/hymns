Tune: O WELT, ICH MUSS DICH LASSEN
File: elh475.txt

[1] Praise God, this hour of sorrow
    Shall bring a brighter morrow;
    I go to Paradise.
    Dear Christian friends together,
    When round my grave you gather,
    Lay me to rest with songs of praise.

[2] What better can befall me
    Than that the Lord doth call me
    From hence, where sin holds sway?
    Who is on earth a stranger
    Must ever be in danger,
    Till God hath closed life's fleeting day.

[3] God takes His own from anguish
    And pain, in which they languish
    Within this vale of tears,
    And gives them to inherit
    The crown that Christ did merit;
    The joy of heav'n's eternal years.

[4] On earth Christ was my treasure,
    And now I know but pleasure
    And gone is bitter woe;
    Believe, whate'er betideth,
    God's love in all abideth,
    And soon your tears shall cease to flow.

[5] Our days the Lord appointeth,
    He woundeth and anointeth,
    He knoweth all things well.
    No evil He effected,
    No good He e'er neglected,
    And all His works His glory tell.

[6] When ye shall see me nearing
    The throne of God, appearing
    Adorned and crowned a bride,
    My palms of vict'ry swinging,
    'Midst Alleluias ringing,
    In beauteous grace the Lamb beside:

[7] Ye then shall rue the sadness
    That made you weep, and gladness
    E'er in your hearts shall reign.
    Who follows where God guideth,
    And takes what He provideth,
    Shall know release from ev'ry pain.

[8] Farewell, I now must leave you;
    The grief this day doth give you
    Soon others, too, shall bear.
    Be ye to God commended;
    In heav'n all woe is ended,
    And we shall meet in glory there.
    Amen
