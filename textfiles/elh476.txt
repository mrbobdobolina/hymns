Hymn #476 - Now Lay We Calmly in the Grave
Tune: DUKE STREET
File: elh476.txt

[1] Now lay we calmly in the grave
    This form, whereof no doubt we have
    That it shall rise again that day
    In glorious triumph o'er decay.

[2] And so to earth we here entrust
    What came from dust and turns to dust
    And from the dust shall surely rise
    When the last trumpet fills the skies.

[3] This soul forever lives in God,
    Whose grace His pardon hath bestowed,
    Who through His Son redeemed us here
    From bondage to both sin and fear.

[4] So help us, Christ, our Hope in loss,
    Thou hast redeemed us by Thy cross
    From endless death and misery;
    We praise, we bless, we worship Thee.
    Amen
