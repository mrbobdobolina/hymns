Hymn #477 - The Will of God Is Always Best
Tune: WAS MEIN GOTT WILL
File: elh477.txt

[1] The will of God is always best
    And shall be done forever;
    And they who trust in Him are blest,
    He will forsake them never.
    He helps indeed In time of need;
    He chastens with forbearing;
    They who depend On God, their Friend,
    Shall not be left despairing.

[2] God is my Comfort and my Trust,
    My Hope and Life abiding;
    And to His counsel, wise and just,
    I yield, in Him confiding.
    The very hairs, His Word declares,
    Upon my head He numbers.
    By night and day God is my Stay,
    He never sleeps nor slumbers.

[3] Lord Jesus, this I ask of Thee,
    Deny me not this favor:
    When Satan sorely troubles me,
    Then do not let me waver.
    Keep watch and ward, O gracious Lord,
    Fulfill Thy faithful saying:
    Who doth believe He shall receive
    An answer to his praying.

[4] When life's brief course on earth is run
    And I this world am leaving,
    Grant me to say, "Thy will be done,"
    By faith to thee still cleaving.
    My heav'nly Friend, I now commend
    My soul into Thy keeping,
    O'er sin and hell, And death as well,
    Through Thee the vict'ry reaping.
    Amen
