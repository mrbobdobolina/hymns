Tune: WAREHAM
File: elh478.txt

[1] Asleep in Jesus! Blessed sleep,
    From which none ever wakes to weep;
    A calm and undisturbed repose,
    Unbroken by the last of foes.

[2] Asleep in Jesus! O how sweet
    To be for such a slumber meet,
    With holy confidence to sing
    That death has lost his venomed sting!

[3] Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest,
    Whose waking is supremely blest;
    No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour
    That manifests the Savior's pow'r.

[4] Asleep in Jesus! O for me
    May such a blissful refuge be!
    Securely shall my ashes lie
    And wait the summons from on high.
    Amen
