Hymn #480 - Now Hush Your Cries
Tune: HAMBURG
File: elh480.txt

[1] Now hush your cries and shed no tear,
    On such death none should look with fear;
    A faithful Christian now has won,
    And with this death true life's begun.

[2] These bones, now dead, again shall feel
    New warmth and vigor through them steal;
    And reunited they shall soar
    On high to live forevermore.

[3] The buried grain of wheat must die,
    And long in withered state must lie,
    Yet springs to light all sweet and fair,
    Its proper fruit at last to bear.

[4] E'en so this body, made of dust,
    To earth we once again entrust,
    Where it shall slumber free from pain
    Till from the dead it rise again.

[5] God breathed into this house of clay
    The spirit that hath passed away;
    The righteous mind, the noble heart,
    The living faith did Christ impart.

[6] Ah! would that promised day were here
    When Christ will once again appear
    And bring them to their heav'nly home
    Who have been buried in the tomb.
    Amen
