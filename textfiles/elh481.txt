Hymn #481 - When My Last Hour Is Close at Hand
Tune: WENN MEIN STUNDLEIN
File: elh481.txt

[1] When my last hour is close at hand,
    Lord Jesus Christ, attend me;
    Beside me then, O Savior, stand
    To comfort and defend me.
    Into Thy hands I will commend
    My soul at this my earthly end,
    And Thou wilt keep it safely.

[2] My sins, dear Lord, disturb me sore,
    My conscience cannot slumber;
    But though as sands upon the shore
    My sins may be in number,
    I will not quail, but think of Thee;
    Thy death, Thy sorrow, borne for me,
    Thy suff'rings, shall uphold me.

[3] I am a branch in Thee, the Vine,
    And hence the comfort borrow
    That Thou wilt surely keep me Thine
    Through fear and pain and sorrow;
    And when I die, I die to Thee,
    Thy precious death hath won for me
    The life that never endeth.

[4] Since Thou the pow'r of death didst rend,
    In death Thou wilt not leave me;
    Since Thou didst into heav'n ascend,
    No fear of death shall grieve me.
    For where Thou art, there shall I be
    That I may ever live with Thee;
    That is my hope when dying.

[5] My spirit I commend to Thee
    And gladly hence betake me;
    Peaceful and calm my sleep shall be,
    No human voice can wake me.
    But Christ is with me through the strife,
    And He will bear me into life
    And open heav'n before me.
    Amen
