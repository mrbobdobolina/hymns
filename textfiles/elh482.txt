Hymn #482 - In Heaven Is Joy and Gladness
Tune: HERZLICH TUT MICH
File: elh482.txt

[1] In heav'n is joy and gladness,
    But while I sojourn here,
    So often, bowed in sadness,
    I shed the bitter tear.
    Here ills, alway prevailing,
    Distress the Savior's bride;
    Here mirth is lost in wailing;
    In heav'n but joys abide.

[2] I do not strive for pleasures
    That fools pursue on earth,
    I sow in tears for treasures
    That have more lasting worth.
    If, when my journey endeth,
    The sheaves I gather in,
    The bliss the fool pretendeth
    I do not yearn to win.

[3] For I shall see my Jesus,
    He is my Hope and Stay;
    The cross that me oppresses
    He then shall take away.
    Then nothing more shall grieve me,
    And no adversity
    Shall of my joy bereave me;
    Soon I shall Jesus see.
    Amen
