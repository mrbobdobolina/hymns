Tune: WER WEISS, WIE NAHE
File: elh483.txt

[1] Who knows when death may overtake me!
    Time passes on, my end draws near.
    How swiftly can my breath forsake me!
    How soon can life's last hour appear!

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.

[2] The world that smiled when morn was breaking
    May change for me ere close of day;
    For while on earth my home I'm making
    Death's threat is never far away.

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.

[3] My end to ponder teach me ever
    And, ere the hour of death appears,
    To cast my soul on Christ, my Savior,
    Nor spare repentant sighs and tears.

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.

[4] Help me now set my house in order
    That always ready I may be
    To say in meekness on death's border:
    "Lord, as Thou wilt, deal Thou with me."

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.

[5] Reveal the sweetness of Thy heaven,
    Earth's galling bitterness unfold;
    May I, amid this turmoil riven,
    Thy blest eternity behold.

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.

[6] My many sins blot out forever
    Since Jesus has my pardon won;
    In mercy robed, I then shall never
    Fear death, but trust in Thee alone.

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.

[7] Naught shall my soul from Jesus sever;
    In faith I touch His wounded side
    And hail Him as my Lord forever,
    Nor life nor death shall us divide.

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.

[8] Once in the blest baptismal waters
    I put on Christ and made Him mine;
    Now numbered with God's sons and daughters,
    I share His peace and love divine.

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.

[9] His body and His blood I've taken
    In His blest Supper, feast divine;
    Now I shall never be forsaken,
    For I am His, and He is mine.

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.

[10] Then may death come today, tomorrow,
     I know in Christ I perish not;
     He grants the peace that stills all sorrow,
     Gives me a robe without a spot.

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.

[11] And thus I live in God contented
     And die without a thought of fear;
     My soul has to God's plans consented,
     For through His Son my faith is clear.

[Refrain] My God, for Jesus' sake I pray
          Thy peace may bless my dying day.
          Amen
