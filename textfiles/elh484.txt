Hymn #484 - Christ Alone Is Our Salvation
Tune: O DURCHBRECHER ALLER BANDE
File: elh484.txt

[1] Christ alone is our salvation,
    Christ the rock on which we stand;
    Other than this sure foundation
    Will be found but sinking sand.
    Christ, His cross and resurrection,
    Is alone the sinner's plea;
    At the throne of God's perfection
    Nothing else can set him free.

[2] We have all things, Christ possessing:
    Life eternal, second birth,
    Present pardon, peace, and blessing
    While we tarry here on earth;
    And by faith's anticipation,
    Foretaste of the joy above
    Freely giv'n us with salvation
    By the Father in His love.

[3] When we perfect joy shall enter,
    'Tis in Him our bliss will rise;
    He's the essence, soul, and center
    Of the glory in the skies.
    In redemption's wondrous story
    Planned before our parents' fall,
    From the cross unto the glory
    Jesus Christ is all in all.
    Amen
