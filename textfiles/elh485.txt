Hymn #485 - O Day of Rest and Gladness
Tune: ELLACOMBE
File: elh485.txt

[1] O day of rest and gladness,
    O day of joy and light,
    O balm for care and sadness,
    Most beautiful, most bright,
    On thee the high and lowly,
    Before th' eternal throne
    Sing, "Holy, holy, holy,"
    To the great Three in One.

[2] On thee at the Creation
    The light first had its birth;
    On thee for our salvation
    Christ rose from depths of earth;
    On thee our Lord victorious
    The Spirit sent from heav'n;
    And thus on thee, most glorious,
    A threefold light was giv'n.

[3] Thou art a cooling fountain
    In life's dry, dreary sand;
    From thee, like Nebo's mountain,
    We view our Promised Land;
    A day of sweet refreshment,
    A day of holy love,
    A day of resurrection
    From earth to things above.

[4] Today on weary nations
    The heav'nly manna falls;
    To holy convocations
    The silver trumpet calls,
    Where Gospel-light is glowing
    With pure and radiant beams
    And living water flowing
    With soul-refreshing streams.

[5] New graces ever gaining
    From this our day of rest,
    We reach the rest remaining
    To spirits of the blest.
    To Holy Ghost be praises,
    To Father, and to Son;
    The Church her voice upraises
    To Thee, blest Three in One.
    Amen
