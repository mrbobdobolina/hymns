Hymn #486 - The Church's One Foundation
Tune: AURELIA
File: elh486.txt

[1] The Church's one foundation
    Is Jesus Christ, her Lord;
    She is His new creation
    By water and the Word.
    From heav'n He came and sought her
    To be His holy bride;
    With his own blood He bought her,
    And for her life He died.

[2] Elect from ev'ry nation,
    Yet one o'er all the earth;
    Her charter of salvation
    One Lord, one faith, one birth.
    One holy name she blesses,
    Partakes one holy food,
    And to one hope she presses,
    With ev'ry grace endued.

[3] The Church shall never perish!
    Her dear Lord, to defend,
    To guide, sustain, and cherish,
    Is with her to the end.
    Though there be those that hate her,
    False sons within her pail,
    Against both foe and traitor
    She ever shall prevail.

[4] Though with a scornful wonder
    Men see her sore oppressed,
    By schisms rent asunder,
    By heresies distressed,
    Yet saints their watch are keeping;
    Their cry goes up, "How long?"
    And soon the night of weeping
    Shall be the morn of song.

[5] Mid toil and tribulation
    And tumult of her war
    She waits the consummation
    Of peace forevermore,
    Till with the vision glorious
    Her longing eyes are blest
    And the great Church victorious
    Shall be the Church at rest.
    Amen
