Tune: DEUS TUORUM MILITUM
File: elh487.txt

[1] O Jesus, Lord of heav'nly grace,
    Thou Brightness of Thy Father's face,
    Thou Fountain of eternal light,
    Whose beams disperse the shades of night.

[2] Come, holy Sun of heav'nly love,
    Send down Thy radiance from above;
    And to our inmost hearts convey
    The Holy Spirit's cloudless ray.

[3] And we the Father's help will claim,
    And sing the Father's glorious name;
    His pow'rful help we now implore,
    That we may stand, to fall no more.

[4] May He our actions deign to bless,
    And loose the bonds of wickedness;
    From sudden falls our feet defend,
    And guide us safely to the end.

[5] May faith, deep rooted in the soul,
    The flesh subdue, the mind control;
    May guile depart, and discord cease,
    And all within be joy and peace.

[6] O hallowed thus be ev'ry day!
    Let meekness be our morning ray,
    And faithful love our noonday light,
    And hope our sunset, calm and bright.

[7] O Christ, with each returning morn,
    Thine image to our hearts is borne;
    O may we ever clearly see
    Our Savior and our God in Thee.
    Amen
