Hymn #488 - I Am, Alone, Your God and Lord
Tune: TALLIS' CANON
File: elh488.txt

[1] I am, alone, your God and Lord;
    All idols are to be abhorred.
    Trust Me, step boldly to My throne;
    With all your hearts love Me alone.

[2] Do not My holy name disgrace,
    Do not My Word of truth abase.
    Praise only that as good and true
    Which I, your God, would say and do.

[3] Hallow the day which God has blest,
    That you and all your house may rest.
    And put aside the work you do
    So that God's Word may work in you.

[4] You are to honor and obey
    Your parents, masters, ev'ry day,
    Serve them each way that comes to hand;
    You'll then live long upon the land.

[5] Curb anger, do not harm or kill,
    Hate not, repay not ill with ill.
    Be patient and of gentle mind,
    Convince your foe that you are kind.

[6] Be faithful to your marriage vows,
    Your heart give only to your spouse,
    Keep your life pure and free from sin,
    By temp'rance and self-discipline.

[7] You shall not steal or cheat away
    What others worked for night and day,
    But open up a gen'rous hand
    To feed the poor in all the land.

[8] False witness you must never bear,
    Nor with your neighbor be unfair;
    The cause of innocence embrace,
    And shield the fallen from disgrace.

[9] By show of right or crafty fame,
    Seek not your neighbor's goods to gain;
    Urge spouse and workers to be true
    To stay and do what they should do.

[10] These Ten Commandments show us all
     The sins our lives hold since the Fall.
     They also help us clearly see
     How pure t'ward God our life should be.
     Amen
