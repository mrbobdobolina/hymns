Hymn #489 - The Law Commands and Makes Us Know
Tune: OLD HUNDREDTH
File: elh489.txt

[1] The Law commands and makes us know
    What duties to our God we owe;
    But 'tis the Gospel must reveal
    Where lies our strength to do His will.

[2] The Law discovers guilt and sin
    And shows how vile our hearts have been;
    The Gospel only can express
    Forgiving love and cleansing grace.

[3] What curses does the Law denounce
    Against the man who fails but once!
    But in the Gospel Christ appears,
    Pard'ning the guilt of num'rous years.

[4] My soul, no more attempt to draw
    Thy life and comfort from the Law.
    Fly to the hope the Gospel gives;
    The man that trusts the promise lives.
    Amen
