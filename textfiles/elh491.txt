Hymn #491 - All Mankind Fell in Adam's Fall
Tune: WENN WIR IN HOCHSTEN NOTEN SEIN
File: elh491.txt

[1] All mankind fell in Adam's fall,
    One common sin infects us all;
    From sire to son the bane descends,
    And over all God's wrath impends.

[2] Through all our pow'rs corruption creeps
    And him in dreadful bondage keeps;
    In guilt he draws our infant breath
    And reaps its fruits of woe and death.

[3] From hearts depraved, to evil prone,
    Flow thoughts and deeds of sin alone;
    God's image lost, the darkened soul
    Nor seeks nor finds its heav'nly goal.

[4] But Christ, the second Adam, came
    To bear our sin and woe and shame,
    To be our Life, our Light, our Way,
    Our only Hope, our only Stay.

[5] As by one man all mankind fell
    And, born in sin, was doomed to hell,
    So by one Man, who took our place,
    We all received the gift of grace.

[6] We thank Thee, Christ; new life is ours,
    New light, new hope, new strength, new pow'rs:
    This grace our ev'ry way attend
    Until we reach our journey's end!
    Amen
