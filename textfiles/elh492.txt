Hymn #492 - The Law of God Is Good and Wise
Tune: ERHALT UNS, HERR
File: elh492.txt

[1] The Law of God is good and wise
    And sets His will before our eyes,
    Shows us the way of righteousness,
    And dooms to death when we transgress.

[2] Its light of holiness imparts
    The knowledge of our sinful hearts
    That we may see our lost estate
    And seek deliv'rance ere too late.

[3] To those who help in Christ have found
    And would in works of love abound
    It shows what deeds are His delight
    And should be done as good and right.

[4] When men the offered help disdain
    And willfully in sin remain,
    Its terror in their ear resounds
    And keeps their wickedness in bounds.

[5] The Law is good; but since the Fall
    Its holiness condemns us all;
    It dooms us for our sins to die
    And has no pow'r to justify.

[6] To Jesus we for refuge flee,
    Who from the curse has set us free,
    And humbly worship at His throne,
    Saved by His grace through faith alone.
    Amen
