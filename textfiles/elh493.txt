Hymn #493 - Before Thee, God, Who Knowest All
Tune: VATER UNSER
File: elh493.txt

[1] Before Thee, God, who knowest all,
    With grief and shame I prostrate fall.
    I see my sins against Thee, Lord,
    The sins of thought, of deed, and word.
    They press me sore; I cry to Thee:
    O God, be merciful to me!

[2] O Lord, my God, to Thee I pray:
    O cast me not in wrath away.
    Let Thy good Spirit ne'er depart,
    But let Him draw to Thee my heart
    That truly penitent I be:
    O God, be merciful to me!

[3] O Jesus, let Thy precious blood
    Be to my soul a cleansing flood.
    Turn not, O Lord, Thy guest away,
    But grant that justified I may
    Go to my house at peace with Thee:
    O God, be merciful to me!
    Amen
