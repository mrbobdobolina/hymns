Hymn #494 - I Know My Faith Is Founded
Tune: NUN LOB, MEIN SEEL
File: elh494.txt

[1] I know my faith is founded
    On Jesus Christ, my God and Lord;
    And this my faith confessing,
    Unmoved I stand upon His Word.
    Man's reason cannot fathom
    The truth of God profound;
    Who trusts her subtle wisdom
    Relies on shifting ground.
    God's Word is all-sufficient,
    It makes divinely sure,
    And trusting in its wisdom,
    My faith shall rest secure.

[2] Increase my faith, dear Savior,
    For Satan seeks by night and day
    To rob me of this treasure
    And take may hope of bliss away.
    But, Lord, with Thee beside me,
    I shall be undismayed;
    And led by Thy good Spirit,
    I shall be unafraid.
    Abide with me, O Savior,
    A firmer faith bestow.
    Then I shall bid defiance
    To ev'ry evil foe.

[3] In faith, Lord, let me serve Thee;
    Though persecution, grief, and pain
    Should seek to overwhelm me,
    Let me a steadfast trust retain.
    And then at my departure
    Take Thou me home to Thee,
    And let me there inherit
    All Thou hast promised me.
    In life and death, Lord, keep me
    Until Thy heav'n I gain,
    Where I by Thy great mercy
    The end of faith attain.
    Amen
