Tune: WENN WIR IN HOCHSTEN NOTEN SEIN
File: elh495.txt

[1] I come to Thee, O blessed Lord,
    Invited by Thy gracious Word
    To this Thy feast, to sup with Thee;
    Grant that a worthy guest I be.

[2] I come to Thee with sin and grief,
    For Thou alone canst give relief.
    Thy death for me, dear Lord, I plead:
    O Jesus, help me in my need!

[3] Shouldst Thou a strict account demand,
    Who could, O Lord, before Thee stand?
    Purge all my secret sins away:
    Be Thou, O Christ, the sinner's Stay!

[4] O Jesus, Lamb of God, alone
    Thou didst for all our sins atone;
    Thought I have sinned and gone astray,
    Turn not, O Lord, Thy guest away.

[5] O Jesus, Lamb of God, alone
    Thou didst for all our sins atone;
    Be merciful, I Thee implore,
    Be merciful forevermore.
    Amen
