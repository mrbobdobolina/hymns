Tune: ABER
File: elh496.txt

[1] Lord Jesus, think on me
    And purge away my sin;
    From earthborn passions set me free
    And make me pure within.

[2] Lord Jesus, think on me,
    With many a care oppressed;
    Let me Thy loving servant be
    And taste Thy promised rest.

[3] Lord Jesus, think on me
    Amid the battle's strife;
    In all my pain and misery
    Be Thou my Health and Life.

[4] Lord Jesus, think on me
    Nor let me go astray;
    Through darkness and perplexity
    Point Thou the heav'nly way.

[5] Lord Jesus, think on me
    When floods the tempest high;
    When on doth rush the enemy,
    O Savior, be Thou nigh!

[6] Lord Jesus, think on me
    That, when the flood is past,
    I may th' eternal brightness see
    And share Thy joy at last.

[7] Lord Jesus, think on me
    That I may sing above
    To Father, Spirit, and to Thee
    The strains of praise and love.
    Amen
