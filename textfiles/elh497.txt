Tune: LOBE DEN HERREN, O MEINE SEELE
File: elh497.txt

[1] Praise the Almighty, my soul, adore Him!
    Yea, I will laud Him until death.
    With songs and anthems I'll come before Him
    As long as He doth give me breath.
    From Him my life and all things came;
    Bless, O my soul, His holy name.
    Alleluia, alleluia!

[2] Trust not in princes, they are but mortal;
    Earth-born they are and soon decay.
    Naught are their counsels at life's last portal,
    When the dark grave doth claim its prey.
    Since, then, no man can help afford,
    Trust ye in Christ, our God and Lord.
    Alleluia, alleluia!

[3] Blessed, yea, blessed is he forever
    Whose help is in the Lord most high,
    Whom from the saving faith naught can sever,
    And who in hope to Christ draw nigh.
    To all who trust in Him, our Lord,
    Counsel and aid He doth afford.
    Alleluia, alleluia!

[4] God the Almighty, the great Creator,
    Ruler of sky and land and sea,
    All things ordained, and sooner or later
    They come to pass unfailingly.
    His rule is over rich and poor,
    His promise ever standeth sure.
    Alleluia, alleluia!

[5] Penitent sinners, for mercy crying,
    Pardon and peace from Him obtain;
    Ever the wants of the poor supplying,
    Their faithful God He doth remain.
    He helps His children in distress,
    The widows and the fatherless.
    Alleluia, alleluia!

[6] Praise, all you nations, the name so holy
    Of Him who doth such wondrous things!
    All that hath being, to praise Him solely,
    With happy heart its Amen sings!
    Children of God, with angel host
    Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
    Alleluia, alleluia!
    Amen
