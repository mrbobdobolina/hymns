Hymn #498 - Wilt Thou Forgive That Sin
Tune: DONNE
File: elh498.txt

[1] Wilt Thou forgive that sin, where I begun,
    Which is my sin, though it were done before?
    Wilt Thou forgive those sins through which I run,
    And do run still, though still I do deplore?
    When Thou hast done,
    Thou hast not done,
    For I have more.

[2] Wilt Thou forgive that sin, by which I've won
    Others to sin, and made my sin their door?
    Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I did shun
    A year or two, but wallowed in a score?
    When Thou hast done,
    Thou hast not done,
    For I have more.

[3] I have a sin of fear that when I've spun
    My last thread, I shall perish on that shore;
    Swear by Thyself, that at my death Thy Son
    Shall shine as He shines now, and heretofore.
    And having done
    that, thou hast done,
    I fear no more.
    Amen
