Hymn #500 - O Thou that Hear'st when Sinners Cry
Tune: HAMBURG
File: elh500.txt

[1] O Thou that hear'st when sinners cry
    Though all my crimes before Thee lie,
    Behold them not with angry look,
    But blot their mem'ry from Thy book.

[2] Create my nature pure within
    And form my soul averse to sin;
    Let Thy good Spirit ne'er depart
    Nor hide Thy presence from my heart.

[3] I cannot live without Thy light,
    Cast out and banished from Thy sight;
    Thy holy joys, my God, restore
    And guard me that I fall no more.

[4] Though I have grieved Thy Spirit, Lord,
    His help and comfort still afford
    And let me now come near Thy throne
    To plead the merits of Thy Son.

[5] A broken heart, my God, my King,
    Is all the sacrifice I bring.
    Look down, O Lord, with pitying eye
    And save the soul condemned to die.

[6] O may Thy love inspire my tongue!
    Salvation shall be all my song;
    And all my pow'rs shall join to bless
    The Lord, my Strength and Righteousness.
    Amen
