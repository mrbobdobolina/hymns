Hymn #501 - God of the Prophets
Tune: OLD 124TH
File: elh501.txt

[1] God of the prophets, bless the prophets' sons;
    Elijah's mantle o'er Elisha cast.
    Each age its solemn task may claim but once;
    Make each one nobler, stronger than the last.

[2] Anoint them prophets, Make their ears attent
    To Thy divinest speech, their hearts awake
    To human need, their lips make eloquent
    To gird the right and ev'ry evil break.

[3] Anoint them priests, strong intercessors, they,
    For pardon and for charity and peace,
    Ah, if with them the world might, now astray,
    Find in our Lord from all its woes release.

[4] Anoint them kings, aye, kingly kings, O Lord.
    Anoint them with the Spirit of Thy Son.
    Theirs not a jeweled crown, a blood-stained sword;
    Theirs, by sweet love, for Christ a kingdom won.

[5] Make them apostles, heralds of Thy cross;
    Forth may they go to tell all realms Thy grace.
    Inspired by Thee, may they count all but loss
    And stand at last with joy before Thy face.
    Amen
