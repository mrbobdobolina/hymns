Tune: PURLEIGH
File: elh502.txt

[1] Lord of the Church, we humbly pray
    For those who guide us in Thy way
    And speak Thy holy Word.
    With love divine their hearts inspire,
    And touch their lips with hallowed fire,
    And needful strength afford.

[2] Help them to preach the truth of God,
    Redemption through the Savior's blood:
    Nor let the Spirit cease
    On all the Church His gifts to show'r;
    To them a messenger of pow'r,
    To us, of life and peace.

[3] So may they live to Thee alone;
    Then hear the welcome word, "Well done!"
    And take their crown above;
    Enter into their Master's joy,
    And all eternity employ
    In praise and bliss and love.
    Amen
