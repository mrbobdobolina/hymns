Tune: O GOTT, DU FROMMER GOTT
File: elh503.txt

[1] Lord Jesus, who art come
    A Teacher sent from heaven
    And by both word and deed
    God's truth to us hast given,
    Thou wisely hast ordained
    The holy ministry
    That we, Thy flock, may know
    The way to God through Thee.

[2] Thou hast, O Lord, returned,
    To God's right hand ascending;
    Yet Thou art in the world,
    Thy kingdom here extending.
    Through preaching of Thy Word
    In ev'ry land and clime
    Thy people's faith is kept
    Until the end of time.

[3] O blessed ministry
    Of reconciliation,
    That shows the way to God
    And brings to us salvation!
    By Thine evangel pure,
    Lord, Thou preserv'st Thy fold,
    Dost call, enlighten, keep,
    Dost comfort and uphold.

[4] Preserve this ministry
    While harvest-days are keeping;
    And since the fields are ripe
    And hands are few for reaping,
    Send workers forth, O Lord,
    The sheaves to gather in
    That not a soul be lost
    Which Thou art come to win.

[5] The servants Thou hast called
    And to Thy Church art giving
    Preserve in doctrine pure
    And holiness of living.
    Thy Spirit fill their hearts,
    Endue their tongues with pow'r;
    What they should boldly speak,
    O give them in that hour!

[6] Yea, bless Thy Word alway,
    Our souls forever feeding;
    And may we never lack
    A faithful shepherd's leading!
    Seek Thou the wand'ring sheep,
    Bind up the sore opprest,
    Lift up the fallen ones,
    And grant the weary rest.

[7] Bring those into Thy fold
    Who still to Thee are strangers;
    Guard those who are within
    Against offense and dangers.
    Press onward with Thy Word
    Till pastor and his fold
    Through faith in Thee, O Christ,
    Thy glory shall behold.
    Amen
