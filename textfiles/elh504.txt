Hymn #504 - Fling Out the Banner! Let It Float
Tune: DEO GRACIAS
File: elh504.txt

[1] Fling out the banner! let it float
    Skyward and seaward, high and wide;
    The sun that lights its shining folds,
    The Cross on which the Savior died.

[2] Fling out the banner! angels bend
    In anxious silence o'er the sign,
    And vainly seek to comprehend
    The wonder of the love divine.

[3] Fling out the banner! heathen lands
    Shall see from far the glorious sight,
    And nations, crowding to be born,
    Baptize their spirits in its light.

[4] Fling out the banner! let it float
    Skyward and seaward, high and wide,
    Our glory, only in the Cross,
    Our only hope, the Crucified.

[5] Fling out the banner! wide and high,
    Seaward and skyward let it shine:
    Nor skill, nor might, nor merit ours;
    We conquer only in that sign.
    Amen
