Tune: PUER NOBIS NASCITUR
File: elh506.txt

[1] Forth in Thy name, O Lord, I go,
    My daily labor to pursue,
    Thee, only Thee, resolved to know
    In all I think, or speak, or do.

[2] The task Thy wisdom hath assigned,
    O let me cheerfully fulfill;
    In all my works Thy presence find,
    And prove Thy good and perfect will.

[3] Thee may I set at my right hand,
    Whose eyes my inmost substance see,
    And labor on at Thy command,
    And offer all my works to Thee.

[4] Give me to bear Thy easy yoke,
    And ev'ry moment watch and pray,
    And still to things eternal look,
    And hasten to Thy glorious day.

[5] For Thee delightfully employ
    Whate'er Thy bounteous grace has giv'n,
    And run my course with even joy,
    And closely walk with Thee to heav'n.
    Amen
