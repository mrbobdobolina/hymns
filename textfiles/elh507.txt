Hymn #507 - Send, O Lord, Thy Holy Spirit
Tune: WERDE MUNTER
File: elh507.txt

[1] Send, O Lord, Thy Holy Spirit
    On Thy servant now, we pray;
    Let him prove a faithful shepherd
    To Thy little lambs alway.
    Thy pure teaching to proclaim,
    To extol Thy holy name,
    And to feed Thy lambs, dear Savior,
    Make his aim and sole endeavor.

[2] Thou, O Lord, Thyself hast called him
    For Thy precious lambs to care;
    But to prosper in his calling,
    He the Spirit's gifts must share.
    Give him wisdom from above,
    Fill his heart with holy love;
    In all weakness be Thou near Him,
    In his prayers, Good Shepherd, hear him.

[3] Help, Lord Jesus, help him nourish
    Our dear children with Thy Word
    That in fervent love they serve Thee
    Till in heav'n their song is heard.
    Boundless blessings, Lord, bestow
    On his faithful toil below
    Till by grace to him is given
    His reward, the crown of heaven.
    Amen
