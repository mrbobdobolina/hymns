Tune: ERHALT UNS, HERR
File: elh508.txt

[1] Arm these Thy soldiers, mighty Lord,
    With Shield of faith and Spirit's Sword.
    Forth to the battle may they go
    And boldly fight against the foe.

[2] With Banner of the Cross unfurled,
    They overcome the evil world
    And so at last receive from Thee
    The palm and crown of victory.

[3] Come, ever-blessed Spirit, come
    And make Thy servants' hearts Thy home.
    May each a living temple be
    Hallowed forever, Lord, to Thee.

[4] Enrich that temple's holy shrine
    With sev'nfold gifts of grace divine;
    With wisdom, lips and knowledge bless,
    With counsel, strength, fear, godliness.

[5] O Trinity in Unity,
    One only God and Persons Three,
    In whom, through whom, by whom, we live,
    To Thee we praise and glory give.

[6] O grant us so to use Thy grace
    That we may see Thy glorious face
    And ever with the heav'nly host
    Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
    Amen
