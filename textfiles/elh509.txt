Tune: STRAF MICH NICHT
File: elh509.txt

[1] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
    Bless the young before Thee;
    Thou their wants and dangers know'st
    Watch them, we implore Thee.
    Here they stand, Hopeful band,
    Faith in Thee confessing,
    Waiting for Thy blessing.

[2] Gentle Savior, they are Thine,
    Thou wilt never lose them;
    May Thy life and love divine
    Melt their tender bosom.
    Lord, we pray That they may
    All like Thee, be holy,
    Loving, meek, and lowly.

[3] Giver Thou of gifts to all,
    No good thing deny them:
    Hear, O hear our earnest call,
    Life and light supply them.
    Strength renew, Keep them true;
    All that stand before Thee,
    Bless them, we implore Thee.
    Amen
