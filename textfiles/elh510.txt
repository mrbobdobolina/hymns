Tune: SPANISH CHANT
File: elh510.txt

[1] Fear and love thy God and Lord,
    And revere His name and Word,
    Holy keep the Sabbath day,
    Honor to thy parents pay,
    Kill not, shun adultery,
    Steal not, lies and slander flee,
    Keep from covetousness free.
    Help me, Lord, I trust in Thee!

[2] In the Father I believe,
    Who to all did being give,
    And in Jesus Christ, His Son,
    Who for all redemption won;
    And my faith I also place
    In the Holy Ghost, whose grace
    Sanctifies our souls and ways.
    Grant me faith through all my days!

[3] Father, throned in heav'n above,
    Hallowed be Thy name in love;
    Let thy kingdom come, we pray,
    And Thy will be done alway;
    Give us food, forgiveness send,
    In temptations aid extend,
    Save us, Lord, when comes our end!
    Amen! Lord, Thy Church defend!

[4] God the Father, God the Son,
    God the Spirit, Three in One,
    I, baptized into Thy name,
    As Thy child Thy blessing claim;
    Grant that by Thy promised grace
    I my trust in Thee may place,
    All my sins with peace replace
    Till in heav'n I see Thy face.

[5] Jesus let my soul be fed
    With Thyself, the living Bread,
    For Thy flesh is meat indeed,
    And Thy cleansing blood I need;
    Let it cleanse from sin and shame,
    Keep me from all harm and blame,
    That Thy death I may proclaim,
    And forever bless Thy name!
    Amen
