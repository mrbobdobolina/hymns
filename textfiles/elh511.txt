Hymn #511 - Lord Jesus Christ, with Us Abide
Tune: ACH BLEIB BEI UNS
File: elh511.txt

[1] Lord Jesus Christ, with us abide,
    For round us falls the eventide;
    Nor let Thy Word, that heav'nly light,
    For us be ever veiled in night.

[2] In these last days of sore distress
    Grant us, dear Lord, true steadfastness
    That pure we keep, till life is spent,
    Thy holy Word and Sacrament.

[3] Lord Jesus, help, Thy Church uphold,
    We are so sluggish, thoughtless, cold,
    O prosper well Thy Word of grace,
    And spread its truth in ev'ry place!

[4] O keep us in Thy Word, we pray;
    The guile and rage of Satan stay!
    O may Thy mercy never cease!
    Give concord, patience, courage, peace.

[5] O God, how sin's dread works abound!
    Throughout the earth no rest is found,
    And falsehood's spirit wide has spread,
    And error boldly rears its head.

[6] And ever is there something new
    Devised to change Thy doctrines true;
    Lord Jesus! as Thou still dost reign,
    Those vain presumptuous minds restrain;

[7] And as the cause and glory, Lord,
    Are Thine, not ours, to us afford
    Thy help and strength and constancy.
    And keep us ever true to Thee.

[8] Thy Word shall fortify us hence,
    It is Thy Church's sure defense;
    O let us in its pow'r confide
    That we may seek no other guide.

[9] O grant that in Thy holy Word
    We here may live and die, dear Lord;
    And when our journey endeth here,
    Receive us into glory there.
    Amen
