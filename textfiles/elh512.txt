Tune: EVAN
File: elh512.txt

[1] My God, accept my heart this day
    And make it always Thine
    That I from Thee no more may stray,
    No more from Thee decline.

[2] Before the cross of Him who died,
    Behold, I prostrate fall;
    Let ev'ry sin be crucified,
    Let Christ be all in all!

[3] Anoint me with Thy Spirit's grace
    And seal me for Thine own
    That I may see Thy glorious face
    And worship near Thy throne.

[4] May the dear blood, once shed for me
    My blest atonement prove
    That I from first to last may be
    The purchase of Thy love!

[5] Let ev'ry thought and work and word
    To Thee be ever giv'n;
    Then life shall be Thy service, Lord,
    And death the gate of heav'n.
    Amen
