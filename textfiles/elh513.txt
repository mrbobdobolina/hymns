Tune: MEIN SCHOPFER, STEH MIR BEI
File: elh513.txt

[1] My Maker, be Thou nigh
    The light of life to give
    And guide me with Thine eye
    While here on earth I live.
    To Thee my heart I tender
    And all my pow'rs surrender;
    Make it my one endeavor
    To love and serve Thee ever.
    Upon Thy promise I rely;
    My Maker, Thou be nigh.

[2] My Savior, wash me clean
    With Thy most precious blood,
    That takes away all sin
    And seals my peace with God.
    My soul in peace abideth
    Within Thy deep wounds hideth.
    There I find full salvation
    And freedom from damnation.
    Without Thee, lost, defiled by sin,
    My Savior, wash me clean.

[3] My Comforter, give pow'r
    That I may stand secure
    When in temptation's hour
    The world and sin allure.
    The Son to me revealing,
    Inspire my thought and feeling,
    His Word of grace to ponder
    Nor let me from Him wander.
    On me Thy gifts and graces show'r:
    My Comforter, give pow'r.

[4] O Holy Trinity.
    To whom I all things owe,
    Thine image graciously
    Within my heart bestow.
    Choose me, though weak and lowly,
    To be Thy temple holy
    Where praise shall rise unending
    For grace so condescending.
    O heav'nly bliss, Thine own to be,
    O Holy Trinity!
    Amen
