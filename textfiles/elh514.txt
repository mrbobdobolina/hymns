Tune: EIN FESTE BURG (ISOMETRIC)
File: elh514.txt

[1] Our Lord and God, O bless this day
    And hear us, we implore Thee;
    None of Thy children turn away
    Who now appear before Thee.
    We come before Thy face
    And pray: Let Thy rich grace
    Descend from heav'n above
    In all Thy wondrous love
    And keep us by Thy Spirit.

[2] O bless Thy Word to all the young;
    Let them, Thy truth possessing,
    Bear witness true with heart and tongue,
    Their faith and ours confessing.
    From mother's arms Thy grace
    With love did them embrace;
    Baptized into Thy name,
    As Thine Thou didst them claim.
    O Lord, as Thine now own them!

[3] When they their vows today renew,
    Accept them with Thy favor;
    And when they promise to be true,
    May then forget it never!
    But they are weak and frail
    When Satan's hosts assail;
    O arm them with Thy might
    And grant that in the fight
    They unto death be faithful!

[4] And when they leave their childhood home,
    When Satan comes alluring,
    May their baptismal grace become
    A refuge reassuring!
    Blest he who then can say:
    "God's cov'nant stands for aye."
    They ne'er shall be undone
    Who trusts in God alone--
    God is their mighty Father!
    Amen
