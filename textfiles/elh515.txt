File: elh515.txt

[1] Thine forever, God of Love!
    Hear us from Thy throne above;
    Thine forever may we be
    Here and in eternity!

[2] Thine forever! O how blest
    They who find in Thee their rest!
    Savior, Guardian, heav'nly Friend,
    O defend us to the end.

[3] Thine forever, Lord of Life!
    Shield us through our earthly strife.
    Thou, the Life, the Truth, the Way,
    Guide us to the realms of day.

[4] Thine forever! Shepherd, keep
    These Thy Frail and trembling sheep.
    Safe alone beneath Thy care,
    Let us all Thy goodness share.

[5] Thine forever! Thou our Guide,
    All our wants by Thee supplied,
    All our sins by Thee forgiv'n,
    Lead us, Lord, from earth to heav'n.
    Amen
