Hymn #516 - O Watch and Pray
Tune: O TRAURIGKEIT
File: elh516.txt

[1] O watch and pray,
    My soul, the way
    Of safety lies before thee;
    Lest thou shouldst be led astray
    And the foe come o'er thee.

[2] Use thou the Word
    Of God, thy Lord;
    All else is unavailing;
    Ev'ry thought and passion guard
    With this shield unfailing.

[3] O make thy choice
    The Spirit's voice
    When He comes to remind thee;
    Then shall peace thine heart rejoice,
    Satan get behind thee.

[4] One secret thought
    With evil fraught,
    Which in the heart was cherished,
    Havoc of God's grace hath wrought,
    And the soul hath perished.

[5] Our evil mind,
    To sin inclined,
    Is drawn by sin around us;
    If a wicked thought we mind,
    Satan soon hath bound us.

[6] One word from hell
    Cast its foul spell
    On Adam with temptation;
    So by one man all men fell
    Under condemnation.

[7] Each soul astray
    From Christ, the way,
    Should keep God's people humble;
    Jesus warns, "O watch and pray,
    Lest ye fall and stumble."

[8] Be on your guard,
    Keep watch and ward,
    Beware of Satan's cunning!
    Watch and pray and trust your Lord
    Till ye see Him coming!
    Amen
