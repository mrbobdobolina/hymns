Hymn #517 - If God Himself Be for Me
Tune: IST GOTT FUR MICH
File: elh517.txt

[1] If God Himself be for me,
    I may a host defy;
    For when I pray, before me
    My foes, confounded, fly.
    If Christ, the Head, befriend me,
    If God be my support,
    The mischief they intend me
    Shall quickly come to naught.

[2] This I believe, yea, rather,
    In this I make my boast,
    That God is my dear Father,
    The Friend who loves me most;
    And that, whate'er betide me,
    My Savior is at hand
    Through stormy seas to guide me
    And bring me safe to land.

[3] I build on this foundation:
    That Jesus and His blood
    Alone are my salvation,
    The true, eternal good.
    Without Him all that pleases
    Is valueless on earth;
    The gifts bestowed by Jesus
    Alone my love are worth.

[4] My Jesus is my Splendor,
    My soul's bright beaming Sun;
    Were He not my Defender,
    Before God's awful throne,
    I never should find favor
    And mercy in His sight,
    But be destroyed forever,
    As darkness by the light.

[5] He canceled my offenses,
    And saved my soul from death;
    'Tis He who ever cleanses
    Me from my sins through faith.
    In Him I can be cheerful,
    Bold, and undaunted aye.
    In Him I am not fearful
    Of God's great Judgment Day.

[6] Naught, naught, can now condemn me,
    Nor set my hope aside;
    Now hell no more can claim me,
    Its fury I deride.
    No sentence e'er reproves me,
    No ill destroys my peace,
    For Christ, my Savior, loves me
    And shields me with His grace.

[7] His Holy Spirit dwelleth
    Within my willing heart,
    Tames it when it rebelleth,
    And soothes the keenest smart.
    He crowns His work with blessing,
    And helpeth me to cry
    "My Father!" without ceasing,
    To Him who dwells on high.

[8] And when my soul is lying
    Weak, trembling, and oppressed,
    He pleads with groans and sighing
    That cannot be expressed;
    But God's quick eye discerns them
    Although they give no sound,
    And into language turns them,
    E'en in the heart's deep ground.

[9] To mine His Spirit speaketh
    Sweet words of holy cheer,
    How God, to Him that seeketh
    For rest, is always near,
    And how He hath erected
    A city fair and new,
    Where what our faith expected
    We evermore shall view.

[10] In yonder home doth flourish
     My heritage, my lot;
     Though here I die and perish,
     My heav'n shall fail me not.
     Though care my life oft saddens
     And causeth tears to flow,
     The light of Jesus gladdens
     And sweetens ev'ry woe.

[11] Who clings with resolution
     To Him whom Satan hates
     Must look for persecution
     Which never here abates;
     Reproaches, griefs, and losses
     Rain fast upon his head,
     A thousand plagues and crosses
     Become his daily bread.

[12] All this I am prepared for,
     Yet I am not afraid;
     By Thee shall all be cared for,
     To whom my vows were paid.
     Though life and limb it cost me,
     And all the earthly store
     Which once so much engrossed me,
     I love Thee all the more.

[13] Not fire, nor sword, nor thunder,
     Shall sever me from Thee;
     Though earth be rent asunder
     Thou'rt mine eternally.
     Not hunger, thirst, nor danger,
     Not pain nor pinching want,
     Nor mighty princes' anger,
     My fearless soul shall daunt.

[14] No angel, and no gladness,
     No throne, no pomp, no show,
     No love, no hate, no sadness,
     No pain, no depth of woe,
     No scheme of man's contrivance,
     Though it be great or small,
     Shall draw me from Thy guidance,
     Nor one of these, nor all!

[15] My merry heart is springing,
     And knows not how to pine;
     'Tis full of mirth and singing,
     And radiancy divine.
     The Sun whose smiles so cheer me
     Is Jesus Christ alone;
     To have Him always near me
     Is heav'n itself begun.
     Amen
