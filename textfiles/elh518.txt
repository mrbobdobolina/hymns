Hymn #518 - Rise! To Arms! With Prayer Employ You
Tune: WACHET AUF
File: elh518.txt

[1] Rise! To arms! With prayer employ you,
    O Christians, lest the Foe destroy you;
    For Satan has designed your fall.
    Wield God's Word, a weapon glorious;
    Against each foe you'll be victorious.
    Our God will set you o'er them all.
    Is Satan strong and fell?
    Here is Immanuel.
    Sing hosanna!
    The strong ones yield,
    With Christ our Shield,
    And we as conqu'ror's hold the field.

[2] Cast afar this world's vain pleasures,
    Aye, boldly fight for heav'nly treasures,
    And steadfast be in Jesus' might.
    He will help, whate'er betide you,
    And naught will harm with Christ beside you;
    By faith you'll conquer in the fight.
    Then shame, thou weary soul!
    Look forward to the goal:
    There joy waits thee.
    The race, then, run;
    The combat done,
    Thy crown of glory will be won.

[3] Wisely fight, for time is fleeting;
    The hours of grace are fast retreating;
    Short, short, is this our earthly way.
    When the trump the dead is waking
    And sinners all with fear are quaking,
    With joy the saints will greet that Day.
    Bless God, our triumph's sure,
    Though long we did endure
    Scorn and trial.
    Thou, Son of God,
    To Thine abode
    Wilt lead the way Thyself hast trod.

[4] Jesus, all Thy children cherish
    And keep them that they never perish
    Whom Thou hast purchased with Thy blood.
    Let new life to us be given
    That we may look to Thee in heaven
    Whenever fearful is our mood.
    Thy Spirit on us pour
    That we may love Thee more--
    Hearts o'erflowing;
    And then will we
    Be true to Thee
    In death and life eternally.
    Amen
