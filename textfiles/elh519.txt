Tune: WAS GOTT TUT
File: elh519.txt

[1] What God ordains is always good:
    His will abideth holy.
    As He directs my life for me,
    I follow meek and lowly.
    My God indeed In ev'ry need
    Doth well know how to shield me;
    To Him, then, I will yield me.

[2] What God ordains is always good:
    He never will deceive me;
    He leads me in His own right way,
    And never will He leave me.
    I take content What He hath sent;
    His hand that sends me sadness
    Will turn my tears to gladness.

[3] What God ordains is always good:
    His loving thought attends me;
    No poison can be in the cup
    That my Physician sends me.
    My God is true; Each morning new
    I'll trust His grace unending,
    My life to Him commending.

[4] What God ordains is always good:
    He is my friend and Father;
    He suffers naught to do me harm,
    Though many storms may gather.
    Now I may know Both joy and woe;
    Someday I shall see clearly
    That He has loved me dearly.

[5] What God ordains is always good:
    Though I the cup am drinking
    Which savors now of bitterness,
    I take it without shrinking.
    For after grief God grants relief,
    My heart with comfort filling
    And all my sorrow stilling.

[6] What God ordains is always good:
    This truth remains unshaken.
    Though sorrow, need, or death be mine,
    I shall not be forsaken.
    I fear no harm, For with His arm
    He shall embrace and shield me;
    So to my God I yield me.
    Amen
