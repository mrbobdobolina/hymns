Hymn #520 - Soldiers of Christ, Arise
Tune: FRANCONIA
File: elh520.txt

[1] Soldiers of Christ, arise
    And put your armor on,
    Strong in the strength which God supplies
    Through His eternal Son.

[2] Strong in the Lord of hosts
    And in His mighty pow'r,
    Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
    Is more than conqueror.

[3] Stand, then, in His great might,
    With all His strength endued;
    But take, to arm you for the fight,
    The whole armor of God,

[4] That, having all things done
    And all your conflicts past,
    Ye may o'ercome through Christ alone
    And stand entire at last.

[5] From strength to strength go on,
    Wrestle and fight and pray;
    Tread all the pow'rs of darkness down
    And win the well-fought day.

[6] Still let the Spirit cry
    In all His soldiers, "Come,"
    Till Christ the Lord descends from high
    And takes the conqu'rors home.
    Amen
