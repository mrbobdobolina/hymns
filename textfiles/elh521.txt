Hymn #521 - How Firm a Foundation
Tune: FOUNDATION
File: elh521.txt

[1] How firm a foundation, you saints of the Lord,
    Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!
    What more can He say than to you He has said,
    To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

[2] "Fear not, I am with you; O be not dismayed,
    For I am your God and will still give you aid;
    I'll strengthen you, help you, and cause you to stand,
    Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.

[3] "When through the deep waters I call you to go,
    The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow,
    For I will be with you in trouble to bless
    And sanctify to you your deepest distress.

[4] "When through fiery trials your pathway shall lie,
    My grace, all-sufficient, will be your supply.
    The flame shall not hurt you; My only design:
    Your dross to consume and your gold to refine."

[5] The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose
    He will not, He cannot, desert to its foes;
    That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
    He never will leave, He will never forsake.
    Amen
