Tune: WENN WIR IN HOCHSTEN NOTEN SEIN
File: elh522.txt

[1] O faithful God, thanks be to Thee
    Who dost forgive iniquity.
    Thou grantest help in sin's distress,
    And soul and body dost Thou bless.

[2] Thy servant now declares to me:
    "Thy sins are all forgiven thee.
    Depart in peace, but sin no more
    And e'er My pard'ning grace adore."

[3] O Lord, we bless Thy gracious heart,
    For Thou Thyself dost heal our smart
    Through Christ our Savior's precious blood,
    Which for the sake of sinners flowed.

[4] Give us Thy Spirit, peace afford
    Now and forever, gracious Lord.
    Preserve to us till life is spent
    Thy holy Word and Sacrament.
    Amen
