Hymn #523 - In the Cross of Christ I Glory
Tune: RATHBUN
File: elh523.txt

[1] In the cross of Christ I glory,
    Tow'ring o'er the wrecks of time.
    All the light of sacred story
    Gathers round its head sublime.

[2] When the woes of life o'ertake me,
    Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
    Never shall the cross forsake me;
    Lo, it glows with peace and joy.

[3] When the sun of bliss is beaming
    Light and love upon my way,
    From the Cross the radiance streaming
    Adds more luster to the day.

[4] Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
    By the cross are sanctified;
    Peace is there that knows no measure,
    Joys that through all time abide.
    Amen
