Tune: IN DICH HAB ICH GEHOFFET
File: elh524.txt

[1] In Thee, Lord, have I put my trust;
    Leave me not helpless in the dust;
    Let me not be confounded.
    Let in Thy Word My faith, O Lord,
    Be always firmly grounded.

[2] Bow down Thy gracious ear to me
    And hear my cries and prayers to Thee;
    Haste Thee for my protection,
    For woes and fear Surround me here.
    Help me in mine affliction.

[3] My God and Shield, now let Thy pow'r
    Be unto me a mighty tow'r
    Whence bravely I defend me
    Against the foes That round me close.
    O Lord, assistance lend me.

[4] Thou art my Strength, my Shield, my Rock,
    My Fortress that withstands each shock,
    My Help, my Life, my Treasure.
    Whate'er the rod, Thou art my God;
    Naught can resist Thy pleasure.

[5] The world for me has falsely set
    Full many a secret snare and net
    To tempt me and to harm me.
    Lord, make them fail, Do Thou prevail,
    Let their disguise not charm me.

[6] With Thee, Lord, have I cast my lot;
    O faithful God, forsake me not,
    To Thee my soul commending.
    Lord, be my Stay, Lead Thou the way
    Now and when life is ending.

[7] All honor, praise, and majesty
    To Father, Son, and Spirit be,
    Our God forever glorious,
    In whose rich grace We'll run our race
    Till we depart victorious.
    Amen
