Hymn #525 - I Know of a Sleep in Jesus' Name
Tune: DEN SIGNEDE DAG
File: elh525.txt

[1] I know of a sleep in Jesus' name,
    A rest from all toil and sorrow;
    Earth folds in her arms my weary frame
    And shelters it till the morrow.
    My soul is at home with God in heav'n;
    Her sorrows are past and over.

[2] I know of a peaceful eventide;
    And when I am faint and weary,
    At times with the journey sorely tried,
    Through hours that are long and dreary,
    Then often I yearn to lay me down
    And sink into blissful slumber.

[3] I know of a morning, bright and fair
    When tidings of joy shall wake us,
    When songs from on high shall fill the air
    And God to His glory take us,
    When Jesus shall bid us rise from sleep--
    How joyous that hour of waking!

[4] O that is a morning dear to me,
    And oft, o'er the mountains streaming,
    In spirit its heav'nly light I see,
    As golden the peaks are beaming.
    Then sing I for joy like birds at dawn
    That carol in lofty lindens.

[5] God's Son to our graves then takes His way,
    His voice hear all tribes and nations;
    The portals are rent that guard our clay,
    And moved are the sea's foundations.
    He calls out aloud, "Ye dead, come forth!"
    In glory we rise to meet Him.

[6] Now opens the Father's house above,
    The names of the blest are given;
    Lord, gather us there; let none we love
    Be missed in the joys of heaven
    Vouchsafe Thou us all a place with Thee;
    We ask through our dear Redeemer.

[7] O Jesus, draw near my dying bed
    And take me into Thy keeping
    And say when my spirit hence is fled,
    "This child is not dead, but sleeping."
    And leave me not, Savior, till I rise
    To praise Thee in life eternal.
    Amen
