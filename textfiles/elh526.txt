Hymn #526 - O How Blest Are Ye Whose Toils Are Ended
Tune: O WIE SELIG
File: elh526.txt

[1] O how blest are ye whose toils are ended,
    Who through death have to our God ascended!
    Ye have arisen
    From the cares which keep us still in prison.

[2] We are still as in a dungeon living,
    Still oppressed with sorrow and misgiving;
    Our undertakings
    Are but toils and troubles and heart-breakings.

[3] Ye meanwhile are in your chambers sleeping,
    Quiet, and set free from all our weeping;
    No cross or sadness
    There can hinder your untroubled gladness.

[4] Christ has wiped away your tears forever;
    Ye have that for which we still endeavor;
    To you are chanted
    Songs that ne'er to mortal ear were granted.

[5] Ah, who would, then, not depart with gladness
    To inherit heav'n for earthly sadness?
    Who here would languish
    Longer in bewailing and in anguish?

[6] Come, O Christ, and loose the chains that bind us;
    Lead us forth and cast this world behind us.
    With Thee, th' Anointed,
    Finds the soul its joy and rest appointed.
    Amen
