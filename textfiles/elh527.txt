Hymn #527 - In the Midst of Earthly Life
Tune: MITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND
File: elh527.txt

[1] In the midst of earthly life
    Snares of death surround us;
    Where, then, flee we in the strife,
    Lest the foes confound us?
    To Thee, alone, our Savior!
    We mourn our grievous sin, which hath
    Stirred the fire of Thy fierce wrath:
    Holy and righteous God!
    Holy and mighty God!
    Holy and all merciful Savior!
    Everliving God!
    Save us, Lord, from sinking
    In death's deep and bitter flood!
    Have mercy, O Lord!

[2] In the midst of death's dark vale,
    Hell's grim pow'rs o'ertake us;
    Who will help when they assail,
    Who secure can make us?
    Thou only, Lord, Thou only!
    It moves Thy tender heart to see
    Our great sin and misery.
    Holy and righteous God!
    Holy and mighty God!
    Holy and all merciful Savior!
    Everliving God!
    Let not hell dismay us
    With its deep and burning flood.
    Have mercy, O Lord!

[3] Into hell's fierce agony
    Sin doth headlong drive us;
    Where shall we for refuge flee,
    Who, O who will hide us?
    Thou only, blessed Savior!
    Thy precious blood was shed to win
    Peace and pardon for our sin.
    Holy and righteous God!
    Holy and mighty God!
    Holy and all merciful Savior!
    Everliving God!
    Lord, preserve and keep us
    In the true faith's comfort.
    Have mercy, O Lord!
    Amen
