Hymn #530 - I Fall Asleep in Jesus' Wounds
Tune: VATER UNSER
File: elh530.txt

[1] I fall asleep in Jesus' wounds;
    There pardon for my sin abounds.
    Yea, Jesus' blood and righteousness
    My jewels are, my glorious dress.
    In these before my God I'll stand
    When I shall reach the heav'nly land.

[2] With peace and joy I now depart;
    God's child I am with all my heart.
    I thank thee, death, thou leadest me
    To that true life where I would be.
    So cleansed by Christ, I fear not death.
    Lord Jesus, strengthen Thou my faith.
    Amen
