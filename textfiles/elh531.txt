Hymn #531 - O Blessed Sun Whose Splendor
Tune: HEAVENLY LOVE
File: elh531.txt

[1] O blessed Sun whose splendor
    Dispels the shades of night;
    O Jesus, my Defender,
    My soul's supreme delight,
    Though fortune should bereave me
    Of all I love the best,
    If Thou Thy love still leave me,
    I freely give the rest.

[2] I know no life divided,
    O Lord of life, from Thee;
    In Thee is life provided
    For all mankind and me;
    I know no death, O Jesus,
    Because I live in Thee;
    Thy death it is which frees us
    From death eternally.

[3] Lord, with this truth impress me,
    And write it on my heart,
    To comfort, cheer, and bless me,
    That Thou my Savior art.
    Thy love it was which sought me,
    Thyself unsought by me,
    And for Thy ransom bought me
    To live for aye in Thee.
    Amen
