Hymn #532 - Jesus Christ, My Sure Defense
Tune: JESUS, MEINE ZUVERSICHT
File: elh532.txt

[1] Jesus Christ, my sure Defense
    And my Savior, ever liveth;
    Knowing this, my confidence
    Rests upon the hope it giveth,
    Though the night of death be fraught
    Still in many an anxious thought.

[2] Jesus, my Redeemer, lives;
    I, too, unto life shall waken.
    Endless joy my Savior gives;
    Shall my courage, then, be shaken?
    Shall I fear? How could the Head
    Rise and leave His members dead?

[3] Nay, too closely am I bound
    Unto Him by hope forever;
    Faith's strong hand the Rock hath found,
    Grasped it, and will leave it never.
    Even death now cannot part
    From its Lord the trusting heart.

[4] I am flesh and must return
    Unto dust, whence I am taken;
    But by faith I now discern
    That from death I shall awaken
    With my Savior to abide
    In His glory, at His side.

[5] Glorified, I shall anew
    With this flesh then be enshrouded;
    In this body I shall view
    God, my Lord, with eyes unclouded,
    In this flesh I then shall see
    Jesus Christ eternally.

[6] Then these eyes my Lord shall know,
    My Redeemer and my Brother;
    In His love my soul shall glow
    I myself, and not another!
    Then the weakness I feel here
    Shall forever disappear.

[7] They who sorrow here and moan
    There in gladness shall be reigning;
    Earthly here the seed is sown,
    There immortal life attaining.
    Here our sinful bodies die,
    Glorified to dwell on high.

[8] Then take comfort and rejoice,
    For His members Christ will cherish.
    Fear not, they will hear His voice;
    Dying, they shall never perish;
    For the very grave is stirred
    When the trumpet's blast is heard.

[9] Laugh to scorn the gloomy grave
    And at death no longer tremble;
    He, the Lord, who came to save,
    Will at last His own assemble.
    They will go their Lord to meet,
    Treading death beneath their feet.

[10] O that ye would set your hearts
     High above all earthly pleasures.
     Take instead what He imparts
     Who hath giv'n you lasting treasures.
     There your heart's affections give
     Where ye shall forever live.
     Amen
