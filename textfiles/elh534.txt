Hymn #534 - The World Is Very Evil
Tune: EWING
File: elh534.txt

[1] The world is very evil,
    The times are waxing late;
    Be sober and keep vigil,
    The Judge is at the gate;
    The Judge that comes in mercy,
    The Judge that comes with might,
    To terminate the evil,
    To diadem the right.

[2] Arise, arise, good Christian,
    Let right to wrong succeed;
    Let penitential sorrow
    To heav'nly gladness lead
    To light that hath no evening,
    That knows no moon nor sun,
    The light so new and golden,
    The light that is but one.

[3] Brief life is here our portion;
    Brief sorrow, short-lived care;
    The life that knows no ending,
    The tearless life, is there.
    O happy retribution:
    Short toil, eternal rest;
    For mortals and for sinners
    A mansion with the blest!

[4] And now we fight the battle,
    But then shall wear the crown
    Of full and everlasting
    And passionless renown;
    And now we watch and struggle,
    And now we live in hope,
    And Zion in her anguish
    With Babylon must cope.

[5] But He whom now we trust in
    Shall then be seen and known;
    And they that know and see Him
    Shall have Him for their own.
    And there is David's fountain
    And life in fullest glow;
    And there the light is golden,
    And milk and honey flow.

[6] O home of fadeless splendor,
    Of flow'rs that bear no thorn,
    Where they shall dwell as children
    Who here as exiles mourn.
    Midst pow'r that knows no limit,
    Where knowledge has no bound,
    The beatific vision
    Shall glad the saints around.

[7] Jerusalem the golden,
    With milk and honey blessed,
    Beneath thy contemplation
    Sink heart and voice oppressed.
    I know not, O I know not,
    What joys await us there,
    What radiancy of glory
    What bliss beyond compare.

[8] They stand, those halls of Zion,
    All jubilant with song
    And bright with many a angel
    And all the martyr throng.
    The Prince is ever in them;
    The daylight is serene;
    The pastures of the blessed
    Are decked in glorious sheen.

[9] There is the throne of David;
    And there, from care released,
    The shout of them that triumph,
    The song of them that feast;
    And they who with their Leader
    Have conquered in the fight
    Forever and forever
    Are clad in robes of white.

[10] For thee, O dear, dear country,
     Mine eyes their vigils keep;
     For very love, beholding
     Thy happy name, they weep.
     The mention of thy glory
     Is unction to the breast
     And medicine in sickness
     And love and life and rest.

[11] O one, O only mansion,
     O Paradise of joy,
     Where tears are ever banished
     And smiles have no alloy!
     The Lamb is all thy splendor,
     The Crucified thy praise;
     His laud and benediction
     Thy ransomed people raise.

[12] With jasper glow thy bulwarks,
     Thy streets with em'ralds blaze;
     The sardius and the topaz
     Unite in thee their rays;
     Thine ageless walls are bonded
     With amethyst unpriced;
     The saints build up thy fabric,
     The cornerstone is Christ.

[13] Thou hast no shore, fair ocean;
     Thou hast no time, bright day,
     Dear fountain of refreshment
     To pilgrims far away!
     Upon the Rock of Ages
     They raise thy holy tow'r;
     Thine is the victor's laurel
     And thine the golden dower.

[14] O sweet and blessed country,
     The home of God's elect!
     O sweet and blessed country
     That eager hearts expect!
     Jesus, in mercy bring us
     To that dear land of rest,
     Who art, with God the Father
     And Spirit, ever blest.
     Amen
