Hymn #535 - Farewell I Gladly Bid Thee
Tune: VALET WILL ICH DIR GEBEN
File: elh535.txt

[1] Farewell I gladly bid thee,
    False, evil world, farewell.
    Thy life is vain and sinful,
    With thee I would not dwell.
    I long to be in heaven,
    In that untroubled sphere
    Where they will be rewarded
    Who served their God while here.

[2] By Thy good counsel lead me,
    O Son of God, my Stay;
    In each perplexing trial
    Help me, O Lord, I pray.
    Mine hour of sorrow shorten,
    Support my fainting heart,
    From ev'ry cross deliver,
    The crown of life impart.

[3] When darkness round me gathers,
    Thy name and cross, still bright,
    Deep in my heart are sparkling
    Like stars in blackest night.
    O heart, this image cherish:
    The Christ on Calvary,
    How patiently He suffered
    And shed His blood for me!

[4] Lord, hide my soul securely
    Deep in Thy wounded side;
    From ev'ry danger shield me
    And to Thy glory guide.
    He has been truly blessed
    Who reaches heav'n above;
    He has found perfect healing
    Who rests upon Thy love.

[5] Lord, write my name, I pray Thee,
    Now in the Book of Life
    And with all true believers
    Take me where joys are rife.
    There let me bloom and flourish,
    Thy perfect freedom prove,
    And tell, as I adore Thee,
    How faithful was Thy love.
    Amen
