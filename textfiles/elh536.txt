Tune: WAS GOTT TUT
File: elh536.txt

[1] O Son of God, we wait for Thee,
    We long for Thine appearing;
    We know thou sittest on the throne,
    And we Thy name are bearing.
    Who trusts in Thee, May joyful be,
    And see Thee, Lord, descending
    To bring us bliss unending.

[2] We wait for Thee, 'mid toil and pain,
    In weariness and sighing;
    But glad that Thou our guilt hast borne,
    And cancelled it by dying.
    Hence, cheerfully May we with Thee
    Take up our cross and bear it,
    Till we relief inherit.

[3] We wait for Thee; here Thou hast won
    Our hearts to hope and duty;
    But while our spirits feel Thee near,
    Our eyes would see Thy beauty;
    We fain would be At rest with Thee
    In peace and joy supernal,
    In glorious life eternal.

[4] We wait for Thee; soon Thou wilt come,
    The time is swiftly nearing;
    In this we also do rejoice,
    And long for thine appearing,
    O bliss 'twill be When Thee we see,
    Homeward thy people bringing,
    With transport and with singing!
    Amen
