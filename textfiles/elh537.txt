Hymn #537 - Day of Wrath
Tune: DIES IRAE
File: elh537.txt

[1] Day of wrath, O day of mourning!
    See fulfilled the prophet's warning:
    Heav'n and earth in ashes burning.
    Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth,
    Through earth's sepulchers it ringeth,
    All before the throne it bringeth.
    O what fear man's bosom rendeth
    When from heav'n the Judge descendeth
    On whose sentence all dependeth.

[2] Death is stuck and nature quaking;
    All creation is awaking,
    To its Judge and answer making.
    Lo, the book, exactly worded,
    Wherein all hath been recorded;
    Thence shall judgment be awarded.
    When the Judge His seat attaineth,
    And each hidden deed arraigneth,
    Nothing unavenged remaineth.

[3] What shall I, frail man, be pleading,
    Who for me be interceding
    When the just are mercy needing?
    King of Majesty tremendous,
    Who dost free salvation send us,
    Fount of pity, then befriend us!
    Righteous Judge, for sin's pollution
    Grant Thy gift of absolution
    Ere the Day of Retribution.

[4] Faint and weary Thou hast sought me,
    On the cross of suff'ring bought me;
    Shall such grace be vainly brought me?
    Think, good Jesus, my salvation
    Caused Thy wondrous incarnation;
    Leave me not to sin's damnation!
    Guilty now I pour my moaning,
    All my shame with anguish owning:
    Hear, O Christ, Thy servant's groaning!

[5] Bows my heart in meek submission,
    Strewn with ashes of contrition;
    Help me in my last condition!
    Worthless are my prayers and sighing;
    Yet, Good Lord, in grace complying,
    Rescue me from fires undying.
    Thou the sinful woman savedst;
    Thou the dying thief forgavest;
    Thus to me true hope vouchsafest!

[6] With Thy favored sheep then place me,
    Nor among the goats abase me,
    But to Thy right hand upraise me.
    While the wicked are confounded,
    Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,
    Call me, with Thy saints surrounded.
    To the rest Thou didst prepare me
    On Thy cross; O Christ, upbear me!
    Spare, O god, in mercy spare me.
    Amen
