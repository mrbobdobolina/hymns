Tune: ES IST GEWISSLICH
File: elh538.txt

[1] The day is surely drawing near
    When God's Son, the Anointed,
    Shall with great majesty appear
    As Judge of all appointed.
    All mirth and laughter then shall cease
    When flames on flames will still increase,
    As Scripture truly teacheth.

[2] A trumpet loud shall then resound
    And all the earth be shaken.
    Then all who in their graves are found
    Shall from their sleep awaken;
    But all who live shall in that hour
    By the Almighty's boundless pow'r
    Be changed at His commanding.

[3] A book is opened then to all,
    A record truly telling
    What each hath done, both great and small,
    When he on earth was dwelling;
    And ev'ry heart be clearly seen,
    And all be known as they have been
    In thoughts and words and actions.

[4] Then woe to those who scorned the Lord
    And sought but carnal pleasures,
    Who here despised His precious Word
    And loved their earthly treasures!
    With shame and trembling they will stand
    And at the Judge's stern command
    To Satan be delivered.

[5] O Jesus, who my debt didst pay
    And for my sin wast smitten;
    Within the Book of Life, O may
    My name be also written!
    I will not doubt; I trust in Thee,
    From Satan Thou hast made me free
    And from all condemnation.

[6] Therefore my Intercessor be
    And for Thy blood and merit
    Declare my name from judgment free
    With all who life inherit,
    That I may see Thee face to face
    With all Thy saints in that blest place
    Which Thou for us hast purchased.

[7] O Jesus Christ, do not delay,
    But hasten our salvation;
    We often tremble on our way
    In fear and tribulation.
    Then hear us when we cry to Thee;
    Come, mighty Judge, and make us free
    From ev'ry evil! Amen.
    Amen
