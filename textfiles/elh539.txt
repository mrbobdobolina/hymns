Hymn #539 - Jerusalem, My Happy Home
Tune: LAND OF REST
File: elh539.txt

[1] Jerusalem, my happy home,
    Name ever dear to me!
    When shall my labors have and end?
    Thy joys when shall I see?

[2] O happy harbor of the saints!
    O sweet and pleasant soil!
    In thee no sorrow may be found,
    No grief, no care, no toil.

[3] In thee no sickness may be seen,
    No hurt, no ache, no sore;
    In thee there is no dread of death,
    But life forevermore.

[4] Thy saints are crowned with glory great;
    They see God face to face;
    They triumph still, they still rejoice:
    Most happy is their case.

[5] There David stands with harp in hand
    As master of the choir;
    Ten thousand times that man were blest
    That might this music hear.

[6] There Mary sings Magnificat
    With tune surpassing sweet;
    And all the virgins chant their parts,
    Sitting about her feet.

[7] There Magdalene hath left her moan
    And cheerfully doth sing
    With blessed saints whose harmony
    In ev'ry street doth ring.

[8] Apostles, martyrs, prophets, there
    Around my Savior stand;
    And soon my friends in Christ below
    Will join the glorious band.

[9] Jerusalem, my happy home!
    My soul still pants for thee;
    Then shall my labors have an end,
    When I thy joy shall see.
    Amen
