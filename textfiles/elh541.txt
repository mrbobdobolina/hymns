Tune: JERUSALEM, DU HOCHGEBAUTE STADT
File: elh541.txt

[1] Jerusalem, thou city fair and high,
    Would God I were in thee!
    My longing heart fain, fain, to thee would fly;
    It will not stay with me.
    Far over vale and mountain,
    Far over field and plain,
    It hastes to seek its Fountain
    And leave this world of pain.

[2] O happy day and yet far happier hour,
    When wilt thou come at last,
    When fearless to my Father's love and pow'r,
    Whose promise standeth fast,
    My soul I gladly render?
    For surely will His hand
    Lead her with guidance tender
    To heav'n, her fatherland.

[3] A moment's space, and gently, wondrously,
    Released from earthly ties,
    Elijah's chariot bears her up to thee
    Through all these lower skies
    To yonder shining regions,
    While down to meet her come
    The blessed angel legions
    And bid her welcome home.

[4] O Zion, hail! Bright city, now unfold
    The gates of grace to me.
    How many a time I longed for thee of old
    Ere yet I was set free
    From yon dark life of sadness,
    Yon world of shadowy naught,
    And God had giv'n the gladness,
    The heritage, I sought!

[5] What glorious throng and what resplendent host
    Comes sweeping swiftly down?
    The chosen ones on earth who wrought the most,
    The Church's brightest crown,
    Our Lord hath set to meet me,
    As in the far-off years
    Their words oft came to greet me
    In yonder land of tears.

[6] The patriarchs' and prophets' noble train,
    With all Christ's foll'wers true,
    Who bore the cross and could the worst disdain
    That tyrants dared to do;
    I see them shine forever,
    All-glorious as the sun,
    Mid light that fadeth never,
    Their perfect freedom won.

[7] And when within that lovely Paradise
    At last I safely dwell,
    What songs of bliss shall from my lips arise,
    What joy my tongue shall tell,
    While all the saints are singing
    Hosannas o'er and o'er,
    Pure hallelujahs ringing
    Around me evermore!

[8] Unnumbered choirs before the shining throne
    Their joyful anthems raise
    Till heav'n's glad halls are ech'ing with the tone
    Of that great hymn of praise
    And all its host rejoices,
    And all its blessed throng
    Unite their myriad voices
    In one eternal song.
    Amen
