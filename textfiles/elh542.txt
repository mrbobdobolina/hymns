Hymn #542 - In Heaven Above
Tune: I HIMMELEN
File: elh542.txt

[1] In heav'n above, in heav'n above,
    Where God our Father dwells:
    How boundless there the blessedness!
    No tongue its greatness tells.
    There face to face, and full and free,
    The everliving God we see,
    Our God, the Lord of hosts!

[2] In heav'n above, in heav'n above,
    What glory deep and bright!
    The splendor of the noonday sun
    Grows pale before its light.
    The mighty sun that goes not down,
    Before whose face clouds never frown,
    Is God, the Lord of hosts!

[3] In heav'n above, in heav'n above,
    No tears of pain are shed,
    For nothing there can fade or die;
    Life's fullness round is spread,
    And like an ocean, joy o'erflows,
    And with immortal mercy glows
    Our God, the Lord of hosts!

[4] In heav'n above, in heav'n above,
    God has a joy prepared,
    Which mortal ear has never heard,
    Nor mortal vision shared,
    Which never entered mortal thought,
    In mortal dreams was never sought,
    O God, the Lord of hosts!
    Amen
