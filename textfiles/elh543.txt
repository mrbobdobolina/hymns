Tune: HAF TRONES LAMPA FARDIG
File: elh543.txt

[1] Rejoice, rejoice, believers,
    And let your light appear;
    The evening is advancing,
    And darker night is near.
    The Bridegroom is arising
    And soon is drawing nigh.
    Up, pray and watch and wrestle;
    At midnight comes the cry.

[2] The watchers, on the mountain
    Proclaim the Bridegroom near;
    Go forth as He approaches
    With alleluias clear.
    The marriage feast is waiting;
    The gates wide open stand.
    Arise, O heirs of glory;
    The Bridegroom is at hand.

[3] The saints, who here in patience
    Their cross and suff'rings bore,
    Shall live and reign forever
    When sorrow is no more.
    Around the throne of glory
    The Lamb they shall behold;
    In triumph lay before Him
    Their diadems of gold.

[4] Our hope and expectation,
    O Jesus, now appear;
    Arise, O Sun so longed for,
    O'er this benighted sphere.
    With hearts and hands uplifted,
    We plead, O Lord, to see
    The day of earth's redemption
    That sets Your people free!
    Amen
