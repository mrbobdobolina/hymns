Hymn #544 - Wake, Awake, for Night Is Flying
Tune: WACHET AUF
File: elh544.txt

[1] "Wake, awake, for night is flying,"
    The watchmen on the heights are crying,
    "Awake, Jerusalem, arise!"
    It is midnight, we are weary,
    With voices strong they call us clearly:
    "Where are you now, O virgins wise?
    The Bridegroom comes, awake!
    Arise! Your lamps now take!
    Alleluia!
    With bridal care yourselves prepare
    To feast with Him, your Groom most fair."

[2] Zion hears the watchword sounding,
    With bridal joy her heart is bounding,
    She wakes, and breaks the spell of sleep.
    For her Lord comes forth in splendor,
    All rich in grace, truth's strong Defender!
    Her Star grows bright mid darkness deep.
    Now come, O precious Crown,
    Lord Jesus, God's own Son.
    Hail, Hosanna!
    We enter all, the marriage hall,
    To eat the Supper at Your call.

[3] All the Church in Christ rejoices
    With human and angelic voices,
    With harp and cymbal's merry tone.
    All twelve gates of that blest city
    Gleam forth with pearls of heav'nly beauty;
    We worship there around the throne.
    No vision ever brought,
    No ear hath ever caught
    Such great glory.
    Blessed, will we, sweet jubilee,
    Sing "Gloria" eternally.
    Amen
