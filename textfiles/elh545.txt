Tune: OLD HUNDREDTH
File: elh545.txt

[1] Lord God, we all to Thee give praise,
    Thank off'rings meet to Thee we raise
    That Thou didst angel hosts create
    Around Thy glorious throne to wait.

[2] They glow with light and heav'nly grace,
    And constantly behold Thy face;
    Obedience to Thy voice they yield,
    And are with godly wisdom filled.

[3] They never rest nor sleep, as we;
    Their whole delight is but to be
    Forever near Thee, gracious Lord,
    Thy little flock to watch and guard.

[4] The foul old dragon and dread foe
    With envy, hate, and wrath doth glow;
    It always is his aim and pride
    Thy Christian people to divide.

[5] As he hath troubled earth of old
    He keep e'en now his deathly hold,
    Chafes madly to annihilate
    All virtue, honor, Church, and State.

[6] Therefore, no halt nor rest he knows;
    A roaring lion round he goes,
    Or lies in wait with baneful snare
    To drive the Christians to despair.

[7] But watchful is the angel band
    That follows Christ on ev'ry hand
    To guard His people where they go
    And break the counsel of the foe.

[8] From Daniel this may well be seen
    When he sat in the lion's den,
    And likewise angels rescued Lot,
    That the ungodly harmed him not.

[9] When, too, those faithful three were cast
    Into the fiery furnace blast,
    No pow'r had fiercest flames to harm
    Against the rescuing angel's arm.

[10] And thus our God, still at this day,
     From harm and many an evil way
     Keeps us by His dear angel guard,
     Placed over us as watch and ward.

[11] They joy when but one sinner turns;
     Their zeal for Jesus ever burns;
     They serve His people day and night
     To bring us to the realms of light.

[12] The little ones, awake, asleep,
     Yea, ev'ry child of His, they keep;
     O'er all His kingdom, far and near,
     They give their kind and loving care.

[13] When death approaches, then they come
     To sooth mid pain and guide us home;
     When from our flesh departs our soul,
     They bear us to our heav'nly goal.

[14] For this, now and eternally,
     Our praise show rise, O God, to Thee,
     Whom all the angel hosts adore
     With joy now and forevermore.

[15] Give us, O Lord, the grace and pow'r
     To serve Thee well each day and hour;
     Grant us the zeal and fervent love
     To serve as angels serve above.

[16] We also pray Thee to defend
     By them unto the latter end,
     Thy fold, that little flock, O Lord,
     That holds in honor Thy blest Word.
     Amen
