Hymn #546 - Around the Throne of God a Band
Tune: WINCHESTER NEW
File: elh546.txt

[1] Around the throne of God a band
    Of glorious angels ever stand;
    Bright things they see, sweet harps they hold,
    And on their heads are crowns of gold.

[2] Some wait around Him, ready still
    To sing His praise and do His will;
    And some, when He commands them, go
    To guard His servants here below.

[3] Lord, give Thy angels ev'ry day
    Command to guide us on our way
    And bid them ev'ry evening keep
    Their watch around us while we sleep.

[4] So shall no wicked thing draw near
    To do us harm or cause us fear;
    And we shall dwell, when life is past,
    With angels round Thy throne at last.
    Amen
