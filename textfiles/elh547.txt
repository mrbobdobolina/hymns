Tune: UNSER HERRSCHER
File: elh547.txt

[1] Jesus, Brightness of the Father,
    Life and Strength of all who live,
    For creating guardian angels
    Glory to Thy name we give
    And Thy wondrous praise rehearse,
    Singing in harmonious verse.

[2] Blessed Lord, by their protection
    Shelter us from harm this day;
    Keep us pure in flesh and spirit,
    Save us from the Foe, we pray,
    And vouchsafe us by Thy grace
    In Thy Paradise a place.

[3] Glory to th' almighty Father
    Sing we with the heav'nly host;
    Glory to the great Redeemer,
    Glory to the Holy Ghost;
    Three in One and One in Three,
    Throughout all eternity!
    Amen
