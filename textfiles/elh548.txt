Hymn #548 - Stars of the Morning
Tune: O QUANTA QUALIA
File: elh548.txt

[1] Stars of the morning, so gloriously bright,
    Filled with celestial resplendence and light,
    These that, where night never followeth day,
    Praise the Thrice Holy One ever and aye.

[2] These are Thy ministers, these are Thou own,
    Lord God of Sabaoth, nearest Thy throne;
    These are Thy messengers, these dost Thou send,
    Help of the helpless ones, man to defend.

[3] Then, when the earth was first poised in mid-space,
    Then, when the planets first sped on their race,
    Then, when were ended the six days' employ,
    Then all the sons of God shouted for joy.

[4] Still let them aid us and still let them fight,
    Lord of angelic hosts, battling for right,
    Till, where their anthems they ceaselessly pour,
    We with the angels may bow and adore.
    Amen
