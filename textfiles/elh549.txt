File: elh549.txt

[1] O God, our Lord, Your holy Word
    Was long a hidden treasure
    Till to its place It was by grace
    Restored in fullest measure.
    For this today Our thanks we say
    And gladly glorify You.
    Your mercy show And grace bestow
    On all who still deny You.

[2] Salvation true By faith in You,
    That is Your Gospel's preaching,
    The heart and core Of Bible lore
    In all its sacred teaching.
    In Christ we must Put all our trust,
    Not in our deeds or labor;
    With conscience pure And heart secure
    Love You, Lord, and our neighbor.

[3] Lord, You alone This work have done
    By Your free grace and favor.
    All who believe Will grace receive
    Through Jesus Christ, our Savior.
    And though the foe Would overthrow
    Your Word with grim endeavor,
    What plan he tries, It always dies;
    Your Word will stand forever.

[4] You are my Lord, And by Your Word
    Death holds no dreadful terrors;
    Your precious blood, My highest good,
    Has blotted out my errors.
    My thanks to You! Your Word is true,
    You keep Your promise ever.
    While here I live, Your grace You give
    And heav'nly bliss forever.
    Amen
