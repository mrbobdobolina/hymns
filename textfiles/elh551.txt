Hymn #551 - Lord, Help Us Ever to Retain
Tune: HERR JESU CHRIST, MEINS
File: elh551.txt

[1] Lord, help us ever to retain
    The Catechism's doctrine plain
    As Luther taught the Word of Truth
    In simple style to tender youth.

[2] Help us Thy holy Law to learn,
    To mourn our sin, and from it turn
    In faith to Thee and to Thy Son
    And Holy Spirit, Three in One.

[3] Hear us, dear Father, when we pray
    For needed help from day to day
    That as Thy children we may live,
    Whom Thou Baptized and didst received.

[4] Lord, when we fall and sin doth stain,
    Absolve and lift us up again;
    And through the Sacrament increase
    Our faith till we depart in peace.
    Amen
