Hymn #552 - Forever with the Lord
Tune: SWABIA
File: elh552.txt

[1] Forever with the Lord!
    Amen! so let it be.
    Life from the dead is in that word,
    'Tis immortality.

[2] Here in the body pent,
    Absent from Him, I roam,
    Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
    A day's march nearer home.

[3] My Father's house on high,
    Home of my soul, how near
    At times to faith's foreseeing eye
    Thy glorious gates appear!

[4] Ah, then my spirit faints
    To reach the land I love,
    The bright inheritance of saints,
    Jerusalem above!

[5] Forever with the Lord!
    O Father, 'tis Thy will.
    The promise of that faithful word
    E'en here to me fulfil.

[6] Be Thou at my right hand,
    Then can I never fail.
    Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand;
    Fight Thou, and I'll prevail.

[7] So when my dying breath
    Shall set my spirit free,
    By death I shall escape from death
    To endless life with Thee.

[8] Knowing as I am known;
    How shall I love that word
    And oft repeat before the throne,
    "Forever with the Lord!"
    Amen
