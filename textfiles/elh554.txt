Tune: SINE NOMINE
File: elh554.txt

[1] For all the saints who from their labors rest,
    Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,
    Thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!

[2] Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress, and their Might,
    Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight;
    Thou in the darkness drear; their one true Light.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!

[3] O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,
    Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old
    And win with them the victor's crown of gold.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!

[4] O blest communion, fellowship divine,
    We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
    Yet all are one in Thee, for all are Thine.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!

[5] And when the fight is fierce, the warfare long,
    Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
    And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!

[6] The golden evening brightens in the west;
    Soon, soon, to faithful warriors cometh rest.
    Sweet is the calm of Paradise the blest.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!

[7] But, lo, there breaks a yet more glorious day:
    The saints triumphant rise in bright array;
    The King of Glory passes on His way.

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!

[8] From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,
    Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
    Singing to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:

[Alleluias] Alleluia! Alleluia!
            Amen
