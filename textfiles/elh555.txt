Hymn #555 - Rise Again, Ye Lion-Hearted
Tune: STRATFORD
File: elh555.txt

[1] Rise again, ye lionhearted
    Saints of early Christendom.
    Whither is your strength departed,
    Whither gone your martyrdom?
    Lo, love's light is on them,
    Glory's flame upon them,
    And their will to die doth quell
    E'en the lord and prince of hell.

[2] These the saints by fear unshaken,
    Facing danger dauntlessly;
    These no witching lust hath taken,
    Lust that lures to vanity.
    Mid the roar and rattle
    Of tumultuous battle
    In desire they soar above
    All that earth would have them love.

[3] Great of heart, they know no turning,
    Honor, gold, they laugh to scorn,
    Quench desires within them burning,
    By no earthly passion torn.
    Mid the lions' roaring,
    Songs of praise outpouring,
    Joyously they take their stand
    On th' arena's bloody sand.

[4] Would to God that I might even
    As the martyred saints of old,
    With the helping hand of Heaven,
    Steadfast stand in battle bold!
    O my God, I pray Thee,
    In the combat stay me.
    Grant that I may ever be
    Loyal, staunch, and true to Thee.
    Amen
