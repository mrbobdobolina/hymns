Hymn #556 - Flung to the Heedless Winds
Tune: YIGDAL
File: elh556.txt

[1] Flung to the heedless winds
    Or on the waters cast,
    The martyrs' ashes, watched,
    Shall gathered be at last.
    And from the scattered dust,
    Around us and abroad,
    Shall spring a plenteous seed
    Of witnesses for God.

[2] The Father hath received
    Their latest living breath,
    And vain is Satan's boast
    Of vict'ry in their death.
    Still, still, though dead, they speak,
    And, trumpet-tongued, proclaim
    To many wak'ning land
    The one availing name.
    Amen
