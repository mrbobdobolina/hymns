Hymn #558 - From All Thy Saints in Warfare
Tune: AURELIA
File: elh558.txt

[1] From all Thy saints in warfare,
    For all Thy saints at rest,
    To Thee, O blessed Jesus,
    All praises be addressed.
    Thou, Lord, didst win the battle
    That they might conqu'rors be;
    Their crowns of living glory
    Are lit with rays from Thee.

[2] Apostles, prophets, martyrs,
    And all the sacred throng
    Who wear the spotless raiment,
    Who raise the ceaseless song;
    For these, passed on before us,
    Savior, we Thee adore,
    And walking in their footsteps,
    Would serve Thee more and more.

[3] Then praise we God the Father,
    And praise we God the Son,
    And God the Holy Spirit,
    Eternal Three in One;
    Till all the ransomed number
    Fall down before the throne,
    And honor, pow'r, and glory
    Ascribe to God alone.
    Amen
