Hymn #560 - Now the Day Is Over
Tune: MERRIAL
File: elh560.txt

[1] Now the day is over,
    Night is drawing nigh.
    Shadows of the evening
    Steal across the sky.

[2] Jesus, give the weary
    Calm and sweet repose;
    With Thy tend'rest blessing
    May our eyelids close.

[3] Comfort ev'ry suff'rer
    Watching late in pain;
    Those who plan some evil
    From their sin restrain.

[4] Through the long night watches
    May Thine angel spread
    Their bright wings above me,
    Watching round my bed.

[5] When the morning wakens,
    Then may I arise
    Pure and fresh and sinless
    In Thy holy eyes.
    Amen
