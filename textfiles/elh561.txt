Hymn #561 - Abide with Me; Fast Falls the Eventide
Tune: EVENTIDE
File: elh561.txt

[1] Abide with me; fast falls the eventide.
    The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.
    When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
    Help of the helpless, O abide with me!

[2] Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
    Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away.
    Change and decay in all around I see;
    O Thou who changest not, abide with me!

[3] Not a brief glance, I beg, a passing word,
    But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord,
    Familiar, condescending, patient, free,
    Come, not to sojourn, but abide with me!

[4] Come not in terrors as the King of kings,
    But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings,
    Tears for all woes, a heart for ev'ry plea;
    O Friend of sinners, thus abide with me!

[5] Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,
    And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
    Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.
    On to the close, O Lord, abide with me!

[6] I need Thy presence ev'ry passing hour.
    What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
    Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
    Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!

[7] I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless;
    Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness.
    Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
    I triumph still if Thou abide with me!

[8] Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes,
    Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies;
    Heav'n's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
    In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!
    Amen
