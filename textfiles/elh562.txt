Hymn #562 - The Sun's Last Beam of Light Is Gone
Tune: WO GOTT ZUM HAUS
File: elh562.txt

[1] The sun's last beam of light is gone,
    The shades of night, comes swiftly on.
    O Christ, our Light, upon us shine
    Lest we to sin's dark ways incline.

[2] We thank Thee that throughout the day
    Thine angels kept all harm away.
    Thy grace from care and vexing fear
    Hath led us on in safety here.

[3] Lord, if we angered Thee today,
    Remember not our sins, we pray;
    But let Thy mercy o'er them sweep
    And give us calm and restful sleep.

[4] Let angels guard our sleeping hours
    And drive away all evil pow'rs;
    Our soul and body, while we sleep,
    In safety, gracious Father, keep.
    Amen
