Hymn #563 - Abide with Us, the Day Is Waning
Tune: WER NUR DEN LIEBEN GOTT
File: elh563.txt

[1] Abide with us, the day is waning;
    Thus prayed the two while on the way.
    We read that Thou, O Lord, remaining,
    Didst all their doubts and fears allay.
    Incline Thine ear, Thou King of grace,
    When, praying thus, we seek Thy face.

[2] At eventide, Thy Spirit sending,
    Help us, O Lord, our watch to keep,
    In prayer devout, before Thee bending,
    Ere we our eyelids close in sleep,
    Confessing sin in deed and word
    With hope of mercy from the Lord.

[3] Abide with us; with heav'nly gladness
    Illumine, Lord, our darkest day;
    And when we weep in pain and sadness
    Be Thou our solace, strength, and stay.
    Tell of Thy woe, Thy vict'ry won,
    When Thou didst pray: "Thy will be done."

[4] Abide with us, O Savior tender,
    That bitter day when life shall end,
    When to the grave we must surrender,
    And fear and pain our hearts shall rend.
    The shield of faith do Thou bestow
    When trembling we must meet the foe.

[5] When earthly help no more availeth,
    To sup with us Thou wilt be nigh;
    Thou givest strength that never faileth,
    In Thee we grave and death defy.
    While earth is fading from our sight,
    Our eyes behold the realms of light.
    Amen
