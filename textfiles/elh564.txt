Tune: WENN WIR IN HOCHSTEN NOTEN SEIN
File: elh564.txt

[1] Before Thy throne I now appear,
    O Lord, bow down Thy gracious ear
    To me and cast not from Thy face
    Thy sinful child that begs for grace.

[2] Thou, Father of eternity,
    Thine image hast impressed on me.
    In Thee I am and live and move
    Nor can exist without Thy love.

[3] Thou hast redeemed me, Son of God,
    Hast shed for me Thy precious blood,
    The Law for my sake hast fulfilled,
    And thus Thy Father's wrath hast stilled.

[4] Thou art my Advocate for aye,
    My Savior, Comfort, and my Stay.
    Thine all-sufficient merit is
    On earth my peace, in heav'n my bliss.

[5] God Holy Spirit, Pow'r Divine,
    Thou workest in this heart of mine;
    Naught can be counted good in me
    But what proceeds alone from Thee.

[6] Through Thee I now my God adore
    And call Him Father evermore;
    Through Thee His word and Sacrament
    I love and hold till life is spent.

[7] Grant that in peace I close mine eyes,
    But on the Last Day bid me rise
    And let me see Thy face fore'er--
    Amen, Amen, Lord, hear my prayer!
    Amen
