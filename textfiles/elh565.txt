Hymn #565 - All Praise to Thee, My God This Night
Tune: EVENING HYMN
File: elh565.txt

[1] All praise to Thee, my God, this night
    For all the blessings of the light.
    Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
    Beneath Thine own almighty wings.
    Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son
    The ill that I this day have done,
    That with the world, myself, and Thee
    I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

[2] Teach me to live that I may dread
    The grave as little as my bed.
    Teach me to die so that I may
    Rise glorious at the awe-full day.
    O may my soul on Thee repose
    And may sweet sleep mine eyelids close,
    Sleep that shall me more vig'rous make
    To serve my God when I awake.

[3] When in the night I sleepless lie,
    My soul with heav'nly thought supply;
    Let no ill dreams disturb my rest,
    No pow'rs of darkness me distress.
    Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
    Praise him, all creatures here below;
    Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host;
    Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
    Amen
