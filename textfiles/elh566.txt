Tune: GOTTLOB, ES GEHT NUNMEHR
File: elh566.txt

[1] Thus far the Lord has led me on,
    Thus far His pow'r prolongs my days;
    And ev'ry evening shall make known
    Some fresh memorial of His grace.

[2] Much of my time has run to waste,
    And I, perhaps, am near my home;
    But He forgives my follies past
    And gives me strength for days to come.

[3] I lay my body down to sleep;
    Peace is the pillow for my head;
    His ever-watchful eye will keep
    Its constant guard around my bed.

[4] Faith in Thy name forbids my fear;
    O may Thy presence ne'er depart!
    And in the morning may I bear
    Thy loving-kindness on my heart!
    Amen
