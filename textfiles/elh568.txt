Hymn #568 - Jesus, Tender Shepherd, Hear Me
Tune: BROCKLESBURY
File: elh568.txt

[1] Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
    Bless Thy little lamb tonight;
    Through the darkness be Thou near me,
    Watch my sleep till morning light.

[2] All this day Thy hand has led me,
    And I thank Thee for Thy care;
    Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me,
    Listen to my evening prayer.

[3] Let my sins be all forgiven,
    Bless the friends I love so well;
    Take me, when I die, to heaven,
    Happy there with Thee to dwell.
    Amen
