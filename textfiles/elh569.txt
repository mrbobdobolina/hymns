Hymn #569 - Now Rest Beneath Night's Shadow
Tune: O WELT, ICH MUSS DICH LASSEN
File: elh569.txt

[1] Now rest beneath night's shadow
    The woodland, field, and meadow;
    The world in slumber lies.
    But Thou, my heart, awake thee,
    To prayer and song betake thee;
    Let praise to thy Creator rise.

[2] The radiant sun hath vanished,
    His golden rays are banished
    By night, the foe of day;
    But Christ, the Sun of gladness,
    Dispelling all my sadness,
    Within my heart holds constant sway.

[3] The rule of day is over
    And shining jewels cover
    The heaven's boundless blue.
    Thus I shall shine in heaven,
    Where crowns of gold are given
    To all who faithful prove and true.

[4] To rest my body hasteth,
    Aside its garments casteth,
    Types of mortality;
    These I put off and ponder
    How Christ will give me yonder
    A robe of glorious majesty.

[5] Lord Jesus, who dost love me,
    O spread Thy wings above me
    And shield me from alarm!
    Though evil would assail me,
    Thy mercy will not fail me;
    I rest in Thy protecting arm.

[6] My loved ones, rest securely,
    For God this night will surely
    From peril guard your heads.
    Sweet slumbers may He send you
    And bid His hosts attend you
    And through the night watch o'er your beds.
    Amen
