Hymn #570 - Now the Light Has Gone Away
Tune: MUDE BIN ICH
File: elh570.txt

[1] Now the light has gone away;
    Father, listen while I pray,
    Asking Thee to watch and keep
    And to send me quiet sleep.

[2] Jesus, Savior, wash away
    All that has been wrong today.
    Help me ev'ry day to be
    Good and gentle, more like Thee.

[3] Let my near and dear ones be
    Always near and dear to Thee.
    O bring me and all I love
    To Thy happy home above.

[4] Now my evening praise I give;
    Thou didst die that I might live.
    All my blessings come from Thee--
    O how good Thou art to me!

[5] Jesus, best and dearest Friend,
    Thou wilt love me to the end.
    Spirit blest, whom I adore,
    Let me love Thee more and more.
    Amen
