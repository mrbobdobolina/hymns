Tune: CHRISTE, DER DU BIST TAG UND LICHT
File: elh571.txt

[1] O Christ, who art the Light and Day,
    Thou drivest night and gloom away;
    O Light of light, whose Word doth show
    The light of heav'n to us below.

[2] All-holy Lord, in humble prayer,
    We ask tonight Thy watchful care.
    O grant us calm repose in Thee,
    A quiet night, from perils free.

[3] Our sleep be pure from sinful stain;
    Let not the Tempter vantage gain
    Or our unguarded flesh surprise
    And make us guilty in Thine eyes.

[4] Asleep though wearied eyes may be,
    Still keep the heart awake to Thee;
    Let Thy right hand outstretched above
    Guard those who serve the Lord they love.

[5] Behold, O God, our Shield, and quell
    The crafts and subtleties of hell;
    Direct Thy servants in all good,
    Whom Thou hast purchased with Thy blood.

[6] O Lord, remember us who bear
    The burden of the flesh we wear;
    Thou who dost o'er our souls defend,
    Be with us even to the end.

[7] All praise to God the Father be,
    All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,
    Whom with the Spirit we adore
    Forever and forevermore.
    Amen
