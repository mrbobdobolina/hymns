Hymn #572 - O Gladsome Light, O Grace
Tune: NUNC DIMITTIS
File: elh572.txt

[1] O gladsome Light, O Grace
    Of God the Father's Face,
    Eternal splendor wearing:
    Celestial, holy, blest,
    Our Savior Jesus Christ,
    Joyful in Thine appearing.

[2] Now, as day fadeth quite;
    We see the evening light,
    Our humble hymn outpouring,
    Father of might unknown,
    Thee, His incarnate Son,
    And Holy Ghost adoring.

[3] To Thee of right belongs
    All praise of holy songs,
    O Son of God, Life-giver;
    Thee, therefore, O Most High,
    The world doth glorify,
    And shall exalt forever.
    Amen
