Hymn #573 - O Lord, My God, I Cry to Thee
Tune: VATER UNSER
File: elh573.txt

[1] O Lord, my God, I cry to Thee;
    In my distress Thou helpest me.
    My soul and body I commend
    Into Thy hands; Thine angel send
    To guide me home and cheer my heart
    When Thou dost call me to depart.

[2] O Jesus Christ, Thou Lamb of God,
    Once slain to take away our load,
    Now let Thy cross, Thine agony,
    Avail to save and solace me,
    Thy death, to open heav'n, and there
    Bid me the joy of angels share.

[3] O Holy Spirit, faithful Friend,
    Grant me Thy comfort to the end.
    When death and hell assail me sore,
    Leave me, oh, leave me, nevermore,
    But bear me safely through the strife,
    As Thou hast promised, into life.
    Amen
