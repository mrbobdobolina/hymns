Hymn #575 - The Sun Has Gone Down
Tune: FAR, VERDEN, FAR VEL
File: elh575.txt

[1] The sun has gone down
    And peace has descended on country and town;
    The songbirds in silence have flown to their nest,
    And flowers are closing their petals in rest;
    So closes my heart to annoyance and care,
    In homage and pray'r,
    In homage and pray'r.

[2] I praise for this day
    The Father in heaven who prospered my way,
    Who shielded from danger, protected from harm,
    Promoted my labor, and strengthened my arm;
    For hours that passed lightly as birds on the wing,
    Thanksgiving I bring,
    Thanksgiving I bring.

[3] Forgive me, O Lord,
    My sins and transgressions in deed and in word!
    Thou knowest my heart and my innermost thought,
    The words I have spoken, the deeds I have wrought,
    My errors and failings I deeply rehor,
    Forgive and restore,
    Forgive and restore!

[4] I ask for no more;
    My light I extinguish and fasten the door,
    And seeking my chamber, betake me to rest;
    Assured that my slumber this night will be blest,
    I fondly confide to Thy care and control
    My body and soul,
    My body and soul.
    Amen
