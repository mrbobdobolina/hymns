Tune: STEPHANOS
File: elh576.txt

[1] Holy Father, in Thy mercy
    Hear our anxious prayer;
    Keep our loved ones who are absent
    'Neath Thy care.

[2] Jesus, Savior, let Thy presence
    Be their light and guide;
    Keep, O keep them in their weakness,
    At Thy side.

[3] When in sorrow, when in danger,
    When in loneliness,
    In Thy love look down and comfort
    Their distress.

[4] May the joy of Thy salvation
    Be their strength and stay!
    May they love and may they praise Thee
    Day by day!

[5] Holy Spirit, let Thy teaching
    Sanctify their life
    Send Thy grace that they may conquer
    In the strife.

[6] Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
    God the One in Three.
    Bless them, guide them, save them, keep them,
    Near to Thee.
    Amen
