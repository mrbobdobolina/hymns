Hymn #577 - Sun of My Soul, Thou Savior Dear
Tune: HURSLEY
File: elh577.txt

[1] Sun of my soul, Thou Savior dear,
    It is not night if Thou be near.
    O may no earthborn cloud arise
    To hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes.

[2] When the soft dews of kindly sleep
    My wearied eyelids gently steep,
    Be my last thought how sweet to rest
    I rest within my Savior's breast.

[3] Abide with me from morn till eve,
    For without Thee I cannot live;
    Abide with me when night is nigh,
    For without Thee I dare not die.

[4] If some poor wand'ring child of Thine
    Has spurned today the voice divine,
    Now, Lord, the gracious work begin;
    Let him no more lie down in sin.

[5] Watch by the sick; enrich the poor
    With blessings from Thy boundless store;
    Be ev'ry mourner's sleep tonight,
    Like infant's slumbers, pure and light.

[6] Come near and bless us when we wake,
    Ere through the world our way we take,
    Till in the ocean of Thy love
    We lose ourselves in heav'n above.
    Amen
