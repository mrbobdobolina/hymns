Hymn #578 - Where Wilt Thou Go
Tune: ACH BLEIB BEI UNS
File: elh578.txt

[1] Where wilt Thou go since night draws near,
    O Jesus Christ, Thou Pilgrim dear?
    Lord, make me happy, be my Guest,
    And in my heart, O deign to rest.

[2] Grant my request, O dearest Friend,
    For truly I the best intend;
    Thou knowest that Thou ever art
    A welcome Guest unto my heart.

[3] The day is now far spent and gone,
    The shades of night come quickly on;
    Abide with me, Thou heav'nly Light,
    And do not leave me in this night.

[4] Enlighten me that from the way
    That leads to heav'n I may not stray,
    That I may never be misled
    Though night of sin is round me spread.

[5] And when I on my death-bed lie,
    Help me that I in peace may die.
    Abide! I will not let Thee go.
    Thou wilt not leave me, Lord, I know.
    Amen
