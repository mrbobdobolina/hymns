Tune: CHRISTUS, DER IST MEIN LEBEN
File: elh579.txt

[1] Abide in grace, Lord Jesus,
    Among us constantly,
    Lest Satan's art deceive us
    And gain the victory.

[2] Abide, Lord, with the story
    Of Thy redeeming love;
    May we the Gospel's glory
    And saving virtue prove.

[3] Abide, our pathway brighten
    With Thy celestial ray;
    Blest Light, our souls enlighten,
    Show us the truth, they way.

[4] Abide with us in blessing,
    Lord of the earth and sky;
    Rich grace and strength possessing,
    Do Thou our need supply!

[5] Abide, our only safety,
    Thy people's sure defense;
    No power can withstand Thee
    Divine Omnipotence!

[6] Abide among us ever,
    Lord, with thy faithfulness;
    Jesus, forsake use never,
    Help us in all distress!
    Amen
