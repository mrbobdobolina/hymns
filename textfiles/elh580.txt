Tune: WENN WIR IN HOCHSTEN NOTEN SEIN
File: elh580.txt

[1] Almighty Father, bless the Word
    Which through Thy grace we now have heard.
    O may the precious seed take root,
    Spring up, and bear abundant fruit.

[2] We praise Thee for the means of grace
    As in Thy courts we seek Thy face.
    Grant, Lord, that we who worshiped here
    May all at last in heav'n appear.
    Amen
