Tune: ACH GOTT UND HERR
File: elh581.txt

[1] Draw us to Thee in mind and heart,
    On heav'nly things attending;
    In spirit hence let us depart,
    To Thee, O Lord, ascending.

[2] Draw us to Thee, O Christ, and guide
    Our erring feet to heaven;
    If Thou, O Lord, with us abide,
    Light to our path is given.

[3] Draw us to Thee, O Thou whose love
    The angels praise adoring;
    Receive our souls to Thee above,
    Thy name in death imploring.

[4] Draw us to Thee, grant us to rise
    To yon abodes of glory;
    On Thee to rest our joyful eyes,
    And fall in praise before Thee.
    Amen
