File: elh582.txt

[1] God of mercy, God of grace,
    Show the brightness of Thy face.
    Shine upon us, Savior, shine;
    Fill Thy Church with light divine,
    And Thy saving health extend
    Unto earth's remotest end.

[2] Let the people praise Thee, Lord!
    Be by all that live adored.
    Let the nations shout and sing
    Glory to their Savior King,
    At Thy feet their tribute pay,
    And Thy holy will obey.

[3] Let the people praise Thee, Lord!
    Earth shall then her fruits afford.
    God to us His blessing give,
    Man to God devoted live;
    All below and all above
    One in joy and light and love.
    Amen
