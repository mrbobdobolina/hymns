Hymn #583 - God's Word Is Our Great Heritage
Tune: EIN FESTE BURG
File: elh583.txt

[1] God's Word is our great heritage,
    And shall be ours forever;
    To spread its light from age to age
    Shall be our chief endeavor.
    Through life it guides our way;
    In death it is our stay.
    Lord, grant while worlds endure,
    We keep its teachings pure,
    Throughout all generations.
    Amen
