Hymn #586 - How Blest Are They Who Hear
Tune: OM HIMMERIGES RIGE
File: elh586.txt

[1] How blest are they who hear God's Word,
    And keep and heed what they have heard!
    They daily grow in wisdom.
    Their light shines brighter day by day,
    And while they tread life's weary way,
    They have the oil of gladness
    To soothe their pain and sadness.

[2] God's Word a treasure is to me,
    Through sorrow's night my sun shall be,
    The shield of faith in battle.
    The Father's hand has written there
    My title as his child and heir,
    "The kingdom's thine forever."
    That promise fails me never.

[3] Today I was my Savior's guest;
    My soul was here so richly blest,
    The bread of life receiving.
    O may thereby my faith prevail
    So that its fruits may never fail
    Till my account is given
    Before God's throne in heaven!
    Amen
