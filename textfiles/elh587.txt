Hymn #587 - Jesus, Still Lead On
Tune: SEELENBRAUTIGAM
File: elh587.txt

[1] Jesus, still lead on
    Till our rest is won;
    And although the way be cheerless,
    We will follow calm and fearless;
    Guide us by Your hand
    To our promised land.

[2] If the way be drear,
    If the foe be near,
    Let no faithless fears o'ertake us,
    Let not faith and hope forsake us;
    Safely past the foe
    To our home we go.

[3] When we seek relief
    From a long-felt grief,
    When temptations come alluring,
    Make us patient and enduring;
    Show us that bright shore
    Where we weep no more.

[4] Jesus, still lead on
    Till our rest be won;
    Heav'nly Leader, still direct us,
    Still support, control, protect us,
    Till we safely stand
    In our promised land.
    Amen
