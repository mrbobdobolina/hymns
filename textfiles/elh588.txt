File: elh588.txt

[1] Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing;
    Fill our hearts with joy and peace;
    Let us each, Thy love possessing,
    Triumph in redeeming grace.
    O refresh us, O refresh us,
    Trav'ling through this wilderness.

[2] Thanks we give and adoration
    For Thy Gospel's joyful sound.
    May the fruits of Thy salvation
    In our hearts and lives abound.
    May Thy presence, may Thy presence
    With us evermore be found.

[3] So that when Thy love shall call us,
    Savior, from the world away,
    Fear of death shall not appall us,
    Glad Thy summons to obey.
    May we ever, may we ever
    Reign with Thee in endless day.
    Amen
