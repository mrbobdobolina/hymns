Tune: ERHALT UNS, HERR
File: elh589.txt

[1] Lord, keep us steadfast in Thy Word;
    Curb those who fain by craft and sword
    Would wrest the Kingdom from Thy Son
    And set at naught all He hath done.

[2] Lord Jesus Christ, Thy pow'r make known,
    For Thou art Lord of lords alone;
    Defend Thy Christendom that we
    May evermore sing praise to Thee.

[3] O Comforter of priceless worth,
    Send peace and unity on earth.
    Support us in our final strife
    And lead us out of death to life.
    Amen
