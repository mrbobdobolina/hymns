Tune: LOBT GOTT, IHR CHRISTEN
File: elh590.txt

[1] O happy day when we shall stand
    Amid the heav'nly throng,
    And sing with hosts from ev'ry land
    The new celestial song,
    The new celestial song.

[2] O blessed day! From far and near
    The servants of the Lord
    Shall meet the ransomed millions there
    Who heard God's saving Word,
    Who heard God's saving Word.

[3] O what a mighty, rushing flood
    Of love and will not cease,
    Shall roll about the throne of God
    In joy and endless peace,
    In joy and endless peace!

[4] God, may Thy bounteous grace inspire
    Our hearts so that we may
    All join the heav'nly, white-robed choir
    Upon that glorious day,
    Upon that glorious day.
    Amen
