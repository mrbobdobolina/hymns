Tune: DARWALL'S 148TH
File: elh594.txt

[1] On what has now been sown
    Thy blessing, Lord, bestow;
    The pow'r is Thine alone
    To make it spring and grow.
    Do Thou in grace the harvest raise,
    And Thou alone shalt have the praise.

[2] To Thee our wants are known,
    From Thee are all our pow'rs;
    Accept what is Thine own
    And pardon what is ours.
    Our praises, Lord, and prayers receive
    And to Thy Word a blessing give.

[3] O grant that each of us,
    Now met before Thee here,
    May meet together thus
    When Thou and Thine appear
    And follow Thee to heav'n, our home.
    E'en so, Amen, Lord Jesus, come!
    Amen
