Hymn #595 - Peace to Soothe Our Bitter Woes
Tune: FRED TIL BOD
File: elh595.txt

[1] Peace, to soothe our bitter woes,
    God in Christ on us bestows;
    Jesus bought our peace with God
    With His holy, precious blood;
    Peace in Him for sinners found,
    Is the Gospel's joyful sound.

[2] Peace to us the Church doth tell,
    'Tis her welcome and farewell:
    Peace was our baptismal dow'r,
    Peace shall bless our dying hour;
    Peace be with you, full and free,
    Now and through eternity.
    Amen
