Tune: FREU DICH SEHR
File: elh596.txt

[1] Praise to Thee and adoration,
    Blessed Jesus, Son of God,
    Who, to serve Thine own creation,
    Didst partake of flesh and blood.
    Teach me that I never may
    From Thy fold or pastures stray,
    But with zeal and joy exceeding
    Follow where Thy steps are leading.

[2] Let me never, Lord, forsake Thee,
    E'en though bitter pain and strife
    On my way shall overtake me;
    But may I through all my life
    Walk in fervent love to Thee,
    In all woes for comfort flee
    To Thy birth, Thy death, and passion;
    Till I see Thy full salvation.
    Amen
