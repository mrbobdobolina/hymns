File: elh598.txt

[1] On my heart imprint Thine image,
    Blessed Jesus, King of Grace,
    That life's riches, cares, and pleasures
    Have no pow'r Thee to efface.
    This the superscription be:
    Jesus, crucified for me,
    Is my Life, my hope's Foundation,
    And my Glory and Salvation.
    Amen
