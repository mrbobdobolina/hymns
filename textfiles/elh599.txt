Hymn #599 - Feed Thy Children, God Most Holy
Tune: SCHMUCKE DICH
File: elh599.txt

[1] Feed Thy children, God most holy;
    Comfort sinners poor and lowly.
    O Thou Bread of Life from heaven,
    Bless the food Thou here hast given!
    As these gifts the body nourish,
    May our souls in graces flourish
    Till with saints in heav'nly splendor
    At Thy feast due thanks we render.
    Amen
