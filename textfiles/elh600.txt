File: elh600.txt

[1] Great God, we praise Thy gracious care,
    Which does our daily bread prepare;
    O bless the earthly food we take,
    And feed our souls for Jesus' sake.

[2] We thank Thee, Lord, for this our food,
    For life and health, and ev'ry good:
    May manna to our souls be giv'n,
    The Bread of Life, sent down from heav'n.
    Amen
