Hymn #601 - Our Table Now with Food Is Spread
Tune: HERRNHUT
File: elh601.txt

[1] Our table now with food is spread;
    O God, who givest daily bread,
    Bless these Thy gifts upon us so
    That strength of body they bestow.

[2] O feed the hungry, God of love,
    Who sigh for bread to Heav'n above;
    Give to our land prosperity,
    And bless the earth, the sky, the sea!

[3] Defend and bless our government,
    And give us all a mind content!
    O grant our souls the heav'nly food
    Which Jesus purchased with His blood.
    Amen
