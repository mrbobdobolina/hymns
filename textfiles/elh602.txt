Tune: AMERICA
File: elh602.txt

[1] God bless our native land!
    Firm may she ever stand
    Through storm and night!
    When the wild tempests rave,
    Ruler of wind and wave,
    Do Thou our country save
    By Thy great might.

[2] For her our prayer shall rise
    To God above the skies;
    On Him we wait.
    Thou who art ever nigh,
    Guarding with watchful eye,
    To Thee aloud we cry,
    God save the State!
    Amen
